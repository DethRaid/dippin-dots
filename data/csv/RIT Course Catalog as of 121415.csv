We will examine the form, style, function, and meaning of important objects and monuments of the past, and consider these in their social, historical and cultural contexts. A chronological study will allow us to recognize when, where and by whom a given object was produced. Once these decisive factors are established, we may try to determine why the object was made, what it meant in its time, place and culture, and whose ideology it served.  Since we are dealing with visual information, the primary goals of this class are to learn how to look, and how to describe and analyze what we see.

Although there will be forays back to the 19th and early 20th centuries, most time will be dedicated to artists of the last three decades.  We will examine texts that propose art to be a form of activism and persuade artists to be responsible for the way they represent the world - and maybe even determine if the goal of art is not to represent it in the first place.  What is Art? What should Art be? What should Art do? But is It Art? are just some of the questions that are asked when art comes into contact with the political - especially when that art proposes to make a political or social change - i.e., when art becomes action. Although these questions may not seem immediately answerable, it is our responsibility to ask them and then attempt to answer them as best we can. The artists and theorists that we will discuss are concerned with problems in our society that effect gender, race, sexuality, poverty, labor issues, and the environment.  Most of these theorists and artists can be classified as angry and confrontational or at least evoking a form of contestation and, therefore, their art and ideas are reflective of these positions.",LEC,,Prerequisites: ARTH-136 or equivalent course.,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,

CIAS,ARTH,576,115141,Modernism and Its Other:  Realism in the Shadow of Expressionism,"This course is an inquiry into one of the major debates of modern art. This debate had a seemingly clear victor.  The idea that the artist expresses his or her individuality and then communicates that self to the rest of humanity through a higher, transcendental, language has dominated the discourse and practice of modernist art.  In retrospect, the art that dominated most of the first half of the 20th century was of an Expressive nature.  On the other hand art that addressed the social and in anyway addressed direct and specific social issues was banished by art's major institutions.  Realism was dead.  In this course we will look at the circumstances of how Realism became subordinated to Expressionism.  We will also address the question of what exactly constituted the practice of realist art.  We will look at the roots of both movements that will take us at times into 18th and 19th centuries.  But mostly we will concentrate on how institutions like the Museum of Modern Art helped define how we see the history of 20th century art as being determined.  We will also explore how Modernism's other, Realism, survived and gained new currency in practices of late 20th and early 21st century art.",LEC,,Prerequisites: ARTH-136 or equivalent course.,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,

CIAS,ARTH,578,115145,Edvard Munch,"The Norwegian artist Edvard Munch (1863-1944) continues to generate a great deal of popular interest, critical scholarship, and reflection. The 4-volume catalogue raisonn of his paintings was published in 2009, and the graphic work appeared in 2001. A painter, printmaker, photographer, and filmmaker, Munch was also a prolific writer, well acquainted with the symbolist poets and playwrights, as well as the broad intellectual drift of the fin-de-Sicle.  He is the one Scandinavian artist included within the Modernist canon and his image, The Scream (1893), is an icon of the modern age.  Munch traveled widely throughout Europe and his work was exhibited in North America beginning with the famous 1913 Armory Show.  This course will examine recent scholarship devoted to Munch and the critical issues that his work addresses.

CIAS,ARTH,581,115144,Realism and the Avant-Garde in Russian Art,"The term avant-garde was originally used to describe the foremost part of an army advancing into battle.  The concept of the avant-garde is considered by some to be synonymous with Modernism.  The radical move away from classical forms of representation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is typical of how one understands the avant-garde.  In Russia, the experiments in art from the mid 1890's through 1922 are seen as modernist avant-garde practices that were extreme departures from art practices of the earlier 19th century.  And although this art is very often described, like other western art of the period, in terms of form rather than with regard to its ideological content.  We will examine the avant-garde's social and, therefore, political underpinnings.  In order to get to the roots of an earlier understanding of the avant-garde, we find in its beginnings the writings of Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon, and Olinde Rodrigues. In Russia the artists who painted images that represented the social world, and therefore put themselves in opposition to the status quo, were known as the Peredvizhniki.  We will try to amend this misunderstanding and connect this group of artists to the Russian formal and political avant-garde of the early 20th century and to the latter non-conformist artists of the second half of the 20th century that coincides with Perestroika and the eventual demise of the Soviet Union.",LEC,,Prerequisites: ARTH-136 or equivalent course.,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CIAS,ARTH,582,115143,Medieval Craft,"In this course, we will explore the history of craft production throughout the Middle Ages.  While modern scholars have often divided art from craft, this distinction did not exist in medieval Europe: artists were craftspeople, producing objects that were both practically and symbolically functional.  This class will focus on the decorative arts including stained glass, ivories, textiles, and metalwork to produce a more integrated picture of medieval visual culture.

CIAS,ARTH,584,115138,Scandinavian Modernism,"This course examines the decorative arts and visual culture of modern Scandinavia from 1860 to the present, with special emphasis on the social, economic, and political impulses that have shaped them.  Scandinavian Modern design plays a significant role in the postwar epoch; it is equated with such leading brands as Volvo, Saab, Ericsson, Nokia, H&M, Electrolux Orrefors, Georg Jensen, ARTEK, Iitala, and IKEA and the idea of progressive, social democracy.

CIAS,ARTH,611,115139,Extreme Abstraction,"Although we can trace the roots of abstraction to non modern times and find its beginning as a concept in the visual arts in the late 18th and through-out the 19th century, it is a predominantly 20th century phenomena.  During the beginning of the 20th century there were many artists that turned to nonfigurative practices for reasons that were mostly cultural and political.  The world was changing and the artists wanted art to change as well.  Although these reasons were about creating new ways of seeing and representing the world the sources for these visions varied from artist to artist.  Scientific discoveries dealing with concepts of evolution, germs, atomic theory and astronomy contributed to the artists theorizing and producing abstract works of art.  And although the work took on a look that may have been associated with decoration, most artists denied this connection for fearing that their work would not be taken seriously.  Merely decorative!  Abstraction since then has gone through many manifestations.  The artists of today are no longer just going through the process of abstracting but are now producing abstract work that has its own history, rules and grammar.  Issues of science, spirituality, primitivism and the decorative still resonate in the work of late 20th and early 21st century artists.  But what is different?",LEC,,This course is restricted to CIAS Graduate students.,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CIAS,ARTH,621,113384,The Image,"The image remains a ubiquitous, controversial, ambiguous and deeply problematic issue in contemporary critical discourse.  Yet, it is also a key concern of visual culture, and a connecting problem across the entirety of CIAS (the College of Imaging Arts and Sciences) here at RIT where the production and consumption of images is paramount.  This course will examine recent scholarship devoted to the image and the ideological implications of the image in contemporary culture.  Topics will include: the modern debate over word vs. image, the mythic origins of images, subversive, traumatic, monstrous, banned and destroyed images (idolatry and iconoclasm), the votive and effigy, the mental image, the limits of visuality, the moving and projected image, the virtual image, image fetishism, the valence of the image, semiotics and the image, as well as criteria by which to assess their success or failure (their intelligibility) and their alleged redemptive and poetic power.",LEC,,This course is restricted to CIAS Graduate students.,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,

CIAS,ARTH,666,200249,Modernism Realism Expressionism,"This course is an inquiry into one of the major debates of modern art. This debate had a seemingly clear victor.  The idea that the artist expresses his or her individuality and then communicates that “self” to the rest of “humanity” through a higher, transcendental, language has dominated the discourse and practice of modernist art.  In retrospect, the art that dominated most of the first half of the 20th century was of an Expressive nature.  On the other hand art that addressed the social and in anyway addressed direct and specific social issues was banished by art’s major institutions.  Realism was dead.  In this course we will look at the circumstances of how Realism became subordinated to Expressionism.  We will also address the question of what exactly constituted the practice of realist art.  We will look at the roots of both movements that will take us at times into 18th and 19th centuries.  But mostly we will concentrate on how institutions like the Museum of Modern Art helped define how we see the history of 20th century art as being determined.  We will also explore how Modernism’s “other”, Realism, survived and gained new currency in practices of late 20th and early 21st century art.",LEC,,This course is restricted to CIAS Graduate students.,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,

CLA,ANTH,103,113109,Archaeology and the Human Past,"Archaeology is the study of the human past, from the origin of our species through to the development of modern, industrial states by means of the physical remains of past human behavior. In studying the past, archaeology seeks to explain how we, as modern humans, came to be. This course investigates how archaeologists study the past, explains how human society has changed over time, and presents an overview of world prehistory. Specific topics include the evolution of modern humans, the peopling of the world, the development of agriculture, the rise of state-level societies and associated social technologies such as writing and urbanism. Case studies will be used throughout to demonstrate how archaeological research is conducted and how archaeologists use their research to formulate explanations of the past that have relevance for the present.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,104,201401,Language and Linguistics,"This course provides a survey of topics having to do with the anthropological study of language and linguistics. We will consider both how language is described and analyzed by linguists and how evidence from language can shed light on a variety of social, cultural, and cognitive phenomena. Topics include: nature of language, origins of language, how languages have been described, diversity in language structure and an overview and comparison of the languages of the world.

Food production, circulation and consumption will be examined critically through examining their local and global import and the assumptions that inform different food systems. Alternatives to industrialized food will be explored through both organic foods and the slow food revolution.  Other themes to be examined will be food and identity, social class and gender in particular.  Students will have the opportunity to sample diverse cuisines and to discuss their relation to both place and culture.

CLA,ANTH,201,114404,Ethnographic Imagination: Wrtg about Society & Culture,"This course explores the politics and poetics of writing about society and culture. Writing is a form of power, in that our representations of people influence the way that others think about and act toward them. The way that social researchers write is therefore shot through with ethical implications and weighty decisions. Critical issues include whether people are objectified, cast as wholly Other, culture-bound or creative, out of the past or coeval, racialized or of a common humanity, problematic or multifaceted, passive or agentive, mystified or perceptive, and mechanical or extraordinary. Writing about society and culture is also poetic. We can convey something of people's life experiences, thoughts, agency, and the constraints within which they lead their lives. How well we do so depends upon our ethical reflexivity and attention to the poetics of language. In this course, we will consider these ethical questions, read experimental texts, and discuss how writing style implicitly conveys social theory.",LEC,,"Prerequisites: Successful completion of one course in Anthropology (ANTH), Sociology (SOCI) or International and Global Studies (INGS) is required.",FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,

How has the production, articulation, and dissemination of cultural forms (images, languages, practices, beliefs) been shaped by global capitalism, media industries, communication technologies, migration, and tourist travels? How are cultural imaginaries forged, exchanged, and circulated among a global consumer public? How has the internationalizing of news, computer technologies, video-sharing websites, blogging sites, and other permutations of instant messaging served to accelerate cultural globalization? Students will be introduced to anthropological perspectives on cultural globalization, the transmission of culture globally, and the subsequent effects on social worlds, peoples, communities, and nations.",LEC,,Prerequisites:  ANTH-102 or ANTH-102H or INGS-101 or minimum of 2nd year level standing.,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,215,113474,Field Methods in Archaeology,"This course introduces students to the methods of archaeological fieldwork. The course begins with the student’s development of a research question and design. We then explore the feasibility of this research through the examination of sampling techniques, site survey, and excavation. Field methods of recording, photography and artifact conservation will also be discussed. Students will be able to analyze the usefulness of the field techniques in light of the archaeological scientific methods for dating, and organic and inorganic analyses. Students should emerge from the course understanding the values of the techniques necessary for proper archaeological excavation towards the reconstruction of the past and the development of an understanding of our present.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,220,200616,Language & Culture,"This introductory course in linguistic anthropology surveys the great variety of ways humans communicate both verbally and non-verbally with an emphasis on cross-cultural communication. The course explores the complex interplay between language and culture. Language is a core element of culture, both as a repository of meaning, and also because it is the primary means through which humans carry out social relationships, share ideas, and contest received understandings. Topics will vary by semester, and may include: metaphor and narrative; language acquisition in relationship to childhood socialization; language, thought and worldview; language and identity; multilingualism; the social contexts of language change; literacy; and the politics of language use and language ideologies.",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,225,114112,Globalizing Africa,"This course introduces students to processes of interconnection, local, regional, national and global, that have altered and continue to impact life in Africa, taking into account the enormous impact of Africans on one another and on those of us living outside of the continent. In the course, we will focus on how past, present and anticipated future events in African movements of people, ideas and things, across time and space effect the reception of new events. We will pay particularly close attention to how the relationships of time and space are formulated and understood by Africans in the present. While the historical past is never completed, but continuous in the present, its diverse contours lead to differently remembered, embodied, and enacted expressions. We will evaluate these diverse expressions in pre-colonial, colonial and neo-colonial encounters as they have changed ideas of self and other, political philosophies and political economic systems, genders and sexualities, generational relations, religions, expressive arts, violence, and health on the African continent and around the globe.",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,230,201133,"Archaeology & Cultural Imagination: History, Interpretation, and Popular Culture","People have been interested in their ancestors and the lives of past people likely for as long as we have been human. But this interest has rarely been disinterested. People have exploited, destroyed, or ignored the remains of previous societies. And how the past is understood has profound effects that ripple through all of society, at different times influencing group identity, political philosophy, art, architecture, literature, and film. The emergence of scientific archaeology in the last 150 years has created its own cultural references, including Indiana Jones and Lara Croft. Each semester this course is offered, a specific topic will examine the cultural context in which archaeologists do their work, what is made of their efforts, and how these are related to larger issues in society.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,235,113966,Immigration to the U.S.,"This course examines immigration to the U.S. within the context of globalization. We examine the push- and pull-factors that generate immigration, and changing immigration policies and debates. We consider how changes in the American workplace have stimulated the demand for foreign workers in a wide range of occupations, from software engineer to migrant farmworker and nanny. We review the cultural and emotional challenges of adapting within the American cultural landscape; transnationalism and connections with the homeland; the experiences of refugees; and how immigration has changed since 9/11. Special attention is given to immigration from Latin America, the largest sending region.",LEC,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,240,114168,Muslim Youth Cultures,"In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in youths and Muslim youths, in particular, as a result of increased media attention to security, religious extremism, and human rights. These concerns, while important, obscure other equally vital aspects of being young and Muslim in rapidly globalizing societies.  Taken in isolation of other informational sources, media representations of Muslim youths contribute to severe forms of misinformation and to negative stereotypes, sources of social anxiety and potential conflict. Students, taking this course, by contrast, will develop critical, anthropological approaches to youths and Muslim youth cultures, taking up Muslim youths' concerns with important aspects of their lives, generation and authority; global capitalism and class distinctions; religious identifications; spaces of memory and the control of public space; global education; new technologies and their affects on sociality, gender and sexuality; war and occupation; and expressive arts.  Through in-depth studies of Muslim youth cultures in the Middle East and Africa, the course offers broad perspectives on the diversity and complexity of Muslim youth cultures and their affects on changing societies, cultures, nations and the world.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,245,113428,Ritual and Performance,"The world’s cultural diversity is most vividly and dynamically displayed through ritual and festival. Ritual is anything but superfluous; rather, some of the most important “work” of culture is accomplished through the perfor-mance of ritual. Through cross-cultural comparison, by way of readings and films, we explore the following dimensions of ritual: symbols, embodiment, emotion, discipline, contestation of tradition and authenticity, and the orchestration of birth, childhood socialization, gender, maturation, marriage, community, hierarchy, world renewal, and death. Written expression is enhanced through drafting, revision, and peer review.",LEC,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,250,114402,Themes in Archaeological Research,"One of the most fascinating dimensions of archaeology is the discovery that people have done essentially the same things in different places and different times, independently of developments elsewhere. Agriculture, writing, urbanism, complex economies, and so on, all have been independently invented multiple times in different parts of the world. This fact raises some intriguing questions about what it means to be human. By comparing how these developments occurred in different places and times, archaeologists can, in a sense, perform experiments on the past. Each semester this course is offered we will focus on a separate theme in archaeological research, such as the transition to agriculture; production, trade, and exchange; the origin of writing; imperialism, colonialism, and warfare; pseudoscience/pseudoarchaeology; or human evolution. We will study competing theoretical perspectives and different world regions to gain a broad understanding of the theme and how both theory and data are used to create a comprehensive understanding of the human past.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,255,114406,Regional Archaeology,"Since the first humans set out from Africa nearly two million years ago, our ancestors and relatives managed to settle in almost every continent. Wherever they went, they left traces of their lives that are tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years deep. We call these traces the archaeological record. Almost everywhere our ancestors settled, they did many of the same things, such as inventing agriculture, cities, writing, and state-level societies. However, they did this in ways unique to each region and time. This course examines the archaeology of a specific region, such as Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica, North Africa, or East Asia, in detail. We examine the geography, culture, archaeological record, and significance of the region to various key themes in archaeological research.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,260,113268,Native North Americans,"This course will examine persistence and change in Native American cultures using archaeological, ethnohistorical, ethnographic, linguistic and autobiographical sources among others.

CLA,ANTH,270,200564,"Cuisine, Culture and Power","Physically, culturally, and socially, humans live through food and drink. Spanning the globe, as nearly limitless omnivores, humans have developed myriad ways of collecting and cultivating food and taking advantage of local environments.  We also put food to work for us socially by creating cuisine. Through cuisine, we forge and nourish relationships, commune with deities, and through luxury choices, demonstrate our ""taste"" and lay claim to elite status. Through the cultural practices of production and consumption of food and drink, we wield power. Food and drink consumption patterns have sustained slavery, poverty, malnutrition, and illegal immigration, and have laid waste to the environment.  In this class, we explore physical, cultural, social, political, and economic dimensions of food and become more aware of how the private, intimate act of a bite connects us to the rest of humanity.",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,275,200816,Global Islam,"This course examines the spread of Islam beyond its origins in the Middle East, and the cultural and social clashes, but also the mutual adjustments that have followed. This course explores core tenets of Islam, but also how its practices and beliefs are altered as practitioners in different countries alternately adopt, co-opt, massage, react to, and reject elements in accordance with the meaningful social, cultural, and political lives they build for themselves. The compatibility of Islam with Western society is often debated in contemporary public discourse. This debate is typically marked by an assumption that Islamic beliefs clash with Western secular democratic ideals, an assumption which results in tensions over mosque building, headscarves, and other public signs of Islamic faith. We will explore the diverse ways of being Muslim from a cross-cultural perspective and the sometimes-challenging negotiation of fulfilling these religious tenets while living in Muslim-minority places.",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,280,113119,Sustainable Development,"The international economic system (capitalist) has demonstrated extraordinary power in distributing goods to the farthest reaches of the globe. At the same time there is an increase in inequality and in the numbers of poor and hungry, often associated with environmental degradation. These changes are especially obvious in cities, but not limited to them. Since 1987, building on the work of the Brundtland Commission, there has been a concerted effort by the United Nations, by non-governmental organizations, by individuals, and by some nation-states to explore paths of more sustainable development. This course explores varied strategies now employed to achieve sustainable development, with particular attention to less developed countries.",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,285,201241,American Indian Languages,"This course is about the indigenous languages of the Americas generally and how they have been studied.

Multivariate quantitative methods are an important tool for understanding these data. This course presents an introduction to quantitative research in sociology and anthropology: how to craft a research question and research design that utilize quantitative data, how to select appropriate quantitative techniques and apply them, how to present results, and how to critically evaluate quantitatively based knowledge claims. Topics include: research design, collecting and cod-ing data, non-metric data, data screening, exploratory data analysis, selection and use of appropriate analysis techniques, comparing groups, exploration of variance, classification, and modeling. The course features laboratory exercises and a final project in which the student selects a research problem and data set, which they analyze and present to the class. .",LEC,,Prerequisites: ANTH-102 or ANTH-102H or ANTH-103 or SOCI-102 or SOCI-103 or INGS-101 or equivalent course.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,305,201243,Investigating Language Change,"This course explores traditional and contemporary approaches to historical linguistics, the study of language change. All languages change through time, but how they change? where these changes come from? In this course, we compare different languages, different dialects of the same language, or different historical stages of a particular language, and investigate the history of languages and also language groups (or families). We investigate hypotheses about the grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation of languages long dead, and explore how languages can give us insights to understanding human prehistory.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,310,111899,African Popular Cultures,"For most people in Africa, participating in popular cultures may be the best or only means of political expression.  Yet, here in the United States, we rarely, if ever, have access to these forms, nor are they sufficiently linked in our imaginations to political processes in Africa or around the world.  Rather, ideas and images about Africa come to us through the lenses of American or European cultures and media, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, exotic depictions in National Geographic, or CNN images of massacres in the Sudan.  These images and the discourses that frame them tend to distance us from African experiences and expressions.  By contrast, students, in this course, will assess the links between popular cultures and politics, with special attention to anthropological theory about African colonial and postcolonial literature, music, oral and ritual expressive forms, and visual media, and the particular political contexts through which they emerge and are performed.  Through the popular cultures of diverse African communities, we will assess the politicization of identity, and the relations of African communities to ethnic, national, religious and global networks.  By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of the enormous impact of popular cultures through which Africans express political sentiments that might otherwise be suppressed.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,312,201130,People Before Cities,"More than half the global population today lives in densely populated urban areas, which are further surrounded by complex networks of smaller communities.  Yet, the earliest cities appeared less than 6,000 years ago, a small fraction of time since our species’ first appearance.  The characteristics that define us as human were forged in radically different social universe from those of today. We lived our lives among not much more than 20-30 other people at any one time, hunting and gathering our food, and occasionally moving from place to place. This lifestyle was so successful and adaptable it endured pressures from more complex societies well into the 20th century. Understanding what life was like in such these small-scale societies is important because the material and social world in which they lived is the foundation for societies where food production, social hierarchy, and occupational specialization are the norm. This course will examine both the ethnographic and archaeological record of hunter/foragers from around the globe in an attempt to understand how it proved to be such a versatile and resilient way of life and how its successes, in fact, laid the foundation for social inequality, complexity, and food production.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,315,114161,The Archaeology of Cities,"The long course of the human existence has been marked by a series of revolutions that have profoundly changed society and that ultimately produced the world we live in today. One of the key revolutions that made our world possible was the invention of urbanism. Cities first appeared in Mesopotamia about 6,000 years ago and since then have been independently invented in many different parts of the world. This course focuses on the pre/historical trajectories of urban development in different world regions, the multiple roles of cities, and their impact on the development of complex societies. We attempt to understand and explain how the city has developed and contributed to the constitution of modern society. Throughout the course we will work on developing a working definition of the city that encompasses urbanism in all its many forms.",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,325,113151,Bodies and Culture,"This course examines the body in culture, society, and history. The course material draws on comparative approaches to the cultural construction of bodies, and the impact of ethnic, gender, racial ideologies on body practices (i.e. surgical alteration, mutilation, beautification, surrogacy, erotica). We will critically investigate the global formation of normative discourses of the body (regarding sexuality, AIDS/illness, reproduction, fat/food) in medical science, consumer culture, and the mass media.

CLA,ANTH,328,201404,Heritage and Tourism,"Tourism is a global industry and an important part of the human experience. There are many forces within tourism that act upon people’s lives, and in particular their environments, economies, cultural heritage, and identity. This course will explore tourism and its many dimensions. Beginning with an examination of kinds of tourism, this course unpacks tourism’s ancient trade and pilgrimage roots as well as its class dynamics of post-industrialization. Other aspects of tourism to be explored include strategies and effects of tourism development and production, nationalism and cultural identity, commoditization and marketing of culture and the ethics of development, labor and infrastructural changes, social inequalities, ecological impact, sustainable tourism, the experience of tourists, ritual and authenticity, and the relationship between tourists and tourism workers.

CLA,ANTH,330,113722,Cultural Images of War and Terror,"This course critically examines the visual culture of war and terror in a global world from an anthropological perspective. Representations of violence are endlessly transmitted on television, on the internet, in print media, in cinema, and recreational games to become part of our everyday visual culture. Whether disseminated as news, documentary truth, or entertainment, the ubiquitous encounters with images of violence require a new form of visual literacy that not only highlights the intersection of the local and the global, but also recognizes the ways in which visual technologies, cultural politics of memory and history, media practices, and national ideologies intervene in the formation of a visual culture of war and terror.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,335,111745,Culture and Politics in Latin America,"This course introduces cultures of Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean in the context of political and economic forces that have shaped them.  We examine Spanish and Portuguese colonialism and its modern-day legacies, including ethnic inequalities, economic vulnerability, and social unrest.  We look at how art, music, and literature have engaged critically with the forces of fascism, revolution, socialism, dictatorship, and neo-colonialism.  We consider indigenous activism, religious diversity, changing experiences and expectations of women and men, rebellion and revolution, impacts of and creative responses to globalization, and Latinos in the U.S.",LEC,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,340,112114,Divided Europe,"As Europe strives for political and economic unity, we see a concurrent push toward inequality, exclusion, and marginalization: minorities, immigrants, refugees, Blacks, Muslims, Jews, Roma or Sinti, and women struggle against discrimination. Not only the legacy of colonialism but the revitalization of nationalism shape contemporary European cultural politics.  Based on an anthropological perspective, this course examines ways in which we can understand a divided Europe through the intersections of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and religion.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,345,113967,Genocide and Post-Conflict Justice,"The destruction and survival of societies often hinges upon the ideas and the social, cultural constructions of identity and belonging.  When ideas fail to incorporate people, essentialist categories of identity, historical memory, and accounts of extreme violence become interrelated, potent sources of destruction. Slavery and exclusive ownership of resources leave people starving or living in perilously polluted environments. Globalizing cultural economies threaten local systems and self-representation. Group identities may be ""sites"" of crises within nation-states and global political, economic and cultural processes.  In this course, we will take critical, anthropological approaches to studies of ethnocide, genocide and post-conflict justice. Students will use critical, anthropological approaches to assess ethnocides and genocides from the 19th century forced assimilation and slaughter of Native Americans and Amazonian Indians to more recent genocides in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, and the Sudan, to understand the impact of globalization on techniques and technologies of genocides, the legal, moral/personal responsibility for genocides, media representations of genocides, and the affects of cultural, historical memory and social, global inequities upon future genocides. Students will use anthropological perspectives on genocide to assess post-conflict concepts of justice, reconstruction and reconciliation and local-global debates about their cultural resonance and effectiveness.",LEC,,Prerequisites: INGS-101 or ANTH-102 or equivalent course.,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,350,112992,The Global Economy and the Grassroots,"Economic globalization has given birth to global, grassroots social movements. This course examines how global economic integration is brought about through multilateral institutions, multinational corporations, outsourcing, trade agreements, international lending, and neoliberal reforms.  We consider impacts (cultural, economic, and health) of these trends on employees, farmers, small businesses, consumers, and the environment in the developed and developing worlds (with special emphasis on Latin America).  We examine beliefs, alternative visions, and strategies of grassroots movements responding to these challenges.",LEC,,This class is restricted to undergraduate students with at least 2nd year standing.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,360,114408,Humans and Their Environment,"Humans and their societies have always been shaped by their environment, but as human societies became more complex, their relationship with their environment changed from one of simple adaptation to one in which they had the power to change their environment. Often, the changes they have wrought have had unintended consequences, forcing societies to adapt to the changes that they themselves have brought about. Although we tend to think that this is a relatively recent phenomenon, humans have been altering their environment since the first human societies made the transition to agriculture over ten thousand years ago, if not longer. In this class, we will use the tools of environmental archaeology to explore the history of human interactions with their environments and to draw lessons on how we could manage that interaction today.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,365,113653,Islamic Culture and the Middle East,"This interdisciplinary course focuses on introducing the fundamentals of the Middle East (a region which includes North Africa), with an emphasis on Islam, to students with little or no prior background in the region or the culture. The framework of Islam is used to explore the significance of how religion -- with its prescriptions for and proscriptions against certain behaviors and societal and cultural norms -- constructs and shapes ways of knowing and understanding material and performance culture. The four themes to be addressed include: (1) Foundations of Islam, (2) Islamic Law and Islamic Sects, (3) Material and Performance Culture in Islam, and (4) Islamic Culture and the West. The rationale for this course is to help students recognize and interpret fundamental concepts of Islamic cultures, to demonstrate how Islamic culture has shaped technologies used in the Middle East, to encourage students' independent thinking about topical events concerning Islam and the Middle East within their historical perspective, and to inspire students to examine how their own cultures change and adapt to the various current global situations involving the Middle East.",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ANTH,370,112918,Media and Globalization,"This course examines the cultural importance of mass media in the context of globalization. By analyzing the global flows of media images across national borders, emphasis is given to the cultural, social, and political impact of global media culture on communities in different parts of the world. How, for example, do mass media represent or shape cultural values and beliefs in developing societies?  What is the role of mass media in forging national and ethnic identities, body images, cultural constructs of sexuality and gender, and the perceptions of war and violence in different societies?",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,

We will also see how some of these simple models give insight into diverse questions such as: Should food stamps be given away freely to those who are poor, or should they be required to purchase them? Why are general practitioners (as opposed to specialists) disproportionately located in smaller towns? Why do firms bundle goods rather than just selling them separately? As far as the final impact is concerned, is there a difference in whether a tax is imposed on the sellers of a product or on buyers of a product? Microeconomics gives the tools to understand and evaluate implications of government as well as business policy decisions.

CLA,ENGL,374,200939,Games and Literature,"Who studies game studies? Writing in games can often be hit or miss, so relying on an established story can provide support and allows the medium to evolve to cover more interesting stories than the typical mass-offering affairs. Still, literature and games are fundamentally different media- and as such these differences must be accounted for when mapping literature onto video games. Will “game studies” ever be as highly regarded as is critical scholarship on, say, literature? Can a video game possess substantial literary merit? Can a video game offer the same depth of characters and insight into the human condition as a novel? Do video games invite the player to do the same things that works of great literature invite the reader to do: identify with the characters, invite him to judge them and quarrel with them, and to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader’s own? In this course we will have these conversations and then go beyond. We will examine works that have visually evocative and varied settings; narratives that make readers wonder what is going to happen next; and a rapidly changing culture that prompts even more questions than it answers.",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ENGL,375,200414,Storytelling Across Media,"This course introduces the basic elements of narrative, reflecting on key concepts in narrative theory such as – story and plot, narration and focalization, characterization, storyspace, and worldmaking – to enhance your understanding of how stories work and your ability to understand how such storytelling strategies convey their meaning and themes.  After an initial exploration of storytelling traditions emerging from oral myth and short stories in print, we expand our inquiries into what a narrative is and what it can do by considering what happens to storytelling in graphic novels, digital games, and in recent electronic literature. Reflecting on competing definitions and varieties of narrative, the course raises the overarching question of why how we access, read, write, and circulate stories as a culture matters. Expect to “read” stories in a variety of media, to review basic concepts and conversations drawn from narrative theory, and to creatively experiment with the storytelling strategies we are analyzing in class. No familiarity with specific print, digital, or visual media necessary, though a willingness to read and reflect on stories in various media and to analyze their cultural significance will be essential.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,ENGL,376,200413,Experimental Writing,"Is it true that literature makes nothing happen?  Experimental writing is built on the opposite assumption! This course introduces students to innovative texts that challenge our usual ways of thinking about the relationship of language to the world: the cultural contexts within which language functions, the conflicts out of which it arises, the aesthetic pleasures with which it is associated, and the purposes – intentional or other – which it serves. Writing experiments can test boundaries and break limits, offering us ways to reconsider and redefine our own experience –social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual.  Moving from magic to modernity, from monster to machine, we will explore the transformative power of experimental writing.  Students are expected to post weekly responses to the readings in Discussions on MyCourses, work with a group to research and prepare a class presentation on a significant experimental writer, and submit a final paper on a theme to be announced.

CLA,ENGL,391,200412,Dangerous Texts,"This course will examine how suppression of information has been orchestrated throughout history in different contexts. The process of suppressing information –of people in power attempting to hide images, sounds and words– must itself be viewed in perspective. We must recognize acts of censorship in relation to their social settings, political movements, religious beliefs, cultural expressions and/or personal identities. The texts that we will study were all considered dangerous enough to be banned by governments. They are dangerous because they represent sexuality, race, politics, and religion in ways that challenge the current political/cultural norms of their given culture. What, then, is so dangerous about a fictional representation? What is it that makes a certain work dangerous at a particular time and how does this danger manifest itself in stories, novels (print and graphic), and poetry? Studying these “dangerous texts” and watching some “dangerous films” we will ask: what features of political and cultural regimes do artists tend to single out for criticism? What is the range of expressive tools they use, including the contemporary context of digital media? What is it that makes intellectuals in general and imaginative writers in particular so potent a threat to established power? Do issues like these matter only in totalitarian regimes, or can we learn something about the book-banning pressures in our own society? How do social media technologies complicate discussions of censorship and creativity?",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing from and reflecting on approaches to women's and gender studies from a variety of disciplines and cultures, we will use these theoretical lenses to read social, cultural, and artistic texts and cultural practices in a new light.  How do cultural texts and practices (such as novels, graphic novels, plastic surgery, invitro fertilization, music videos, bulimia, facebook, video games, advertising, etc.) encourage us to think about gender, sex, sexuality, race, class, nation, transnation, science and power?  What role do they play in processes of identity formation? How do power-laden ideas of gender, sexuality, race and class travel from culture to culture or refuse an easy translation?  What old and new discourses of gender, sex, sexuality, race, colonialism, or biopower do these texts help in, or resist disseminating?  How has women's and gender studies and the creative, activist and academic practices theorized in this multidisciplinary, global space, challenged gendered and racialized power structures in the past, in the present, and how might it transform its methods to confront current challenges?  What connections can be drawn between women around the world without erasing their distinct differences?

The study begins with a meditation on the language of maps and mapmaking, and how they work, and explores the idea that to present a useful and truthful picture, an accurate map must tell lies. The course develops into an exploration of the ways, particularly in texts, that mapmaking creates cultural routes, mobile forms of ethnography, and ways of imagining travel and tourism in the era of globalization. The proliferation of location-aware mobile devices calls for new understanding of space and networks of power, as we define public space and locational privacy.

CLA,FNRT,776,200552,Visual Culture,"FNRT 776  is a graduate-level counterpart to FNRT 476.  As such, students enrolled under the 776 number will be required to read the otherwise “recommended” reading; meet with the professor outside of class for an additional weekly discussion; and produce a final project that connects with their thesis work.  Following current debate in the Journal of Visual Culture and calls for upcoming conferences on Visual Culture, graduate students will approach images as sites of gesture and as agents of intellectual productivity.  Visual Culture studies recognize the predominance of visual forms of media, communication, and information in the contemporary world, investigating both “high"" cultural forms such as fine art, design, and architecture and popular ""low"" cultural forms associated with mass media and communications. Visual Culture studies represents a turn in the discourse of the visual, which had focused on content-based, critical readings of images, and has since broadened its approach to additionally question the ways in which our consumption and production of images and image based technologies are structured. Analyzing images from a social-historical perspective, visual culture asks: what are the effects of images? Can the visual be properly investigated with traditional methodologies, which have been based on language, not imagery? How do images visualize social difference? How are images viewed by varied audiences? How are images embedded in a wider culture and how do they circulate?",LEC,,This class is restricted to degree-seeking graduate students or those with permission from instructor.,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,

Students enrolled under the 777 number will be required to read the City and Culture Reader in addition to regular course readings; meet with the professor outside of class for an additional weekly discussion; and produce a final project that connects with their thesis work.  Examining the ways in which culture, ethnicity, languages, traditions, governance, policies and histories interact in the production of the visual experience, graduate level students will approach the campus of RIT and the city of Rochester and their various urban spatial forms as image experiences, subject to interpretative strategies and the influence of other discourses. We will wander the well-traveled and the unbeaten paths, participating in and interrogating a wide range of our campus’ and city’s treasures and embarrassments, secrets and norms.  In addition to these field trips, we will be reading from literature and cultural studies, as well as viewing films, advertisements and websites, and possibly attending theatrical and music performances or sporting events.",LEC,,This class is restricted to degree-seeking graduate students or those with permission from instructor.,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,FNRT,783,200553,Traumatic Images,"FNRT 783 is a graduate-level counterpart to FNRT 483.  Students enrolled under the 783 number will be required to read extensively in trauma theory, especially Cathy Caruth, Ruth Leys, Lisa Saltzman and Eric Rosenberg. This theoretical discourse will contextualize course readings and material. Students will also meet with the professor outside of class for an additional weekly discussion; and produce a final project that connects with their thesis work.  

Traumatic Images investigates visual culture and its imagistic response to life's crises. Problems of identity and identification will be explored and confronted through works of photography, painting, mixed media, new media and film of the 19th, 20th and 21st Centuries. Beginning with the late 19th Century vogue for images of ""hysterical"" women, crippled ""black-sheep"" family members and dead loved ones (as corpses and as ghosts), we then move on to consider the last century's fascination with pain and suffering, disease and violence, struggle and survival and then the 21st Century’s emphasis on terrorism. Specifically, we will focus on the gendering of images and imaging as disturbing pictures work to defy the formal and theoretical distinction between private and public, personal and collective experience and manage the often conflicting responsibilities to self, family, religion, race, nation and society.",LEC,,This class is restricted to degree-seeking graduate students or those with permission from instructor.,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,FNRT,784,200555,Art of Dying,"FNRT 784 is a graduate-level counterpart to FNRT 484.  Under the 784 number, graduate students will explore various disciplinary critiques of mourning practices and attitudes toward death. This interdisplinary discourse will contextualize concepts of pathorgraphy and autopathorgraphy. Students will also meet with the professor outside of class for an additional weekly discussion; and produce a final project that connects with their thesis work.  This course explores the experience of dying—a profoundly human and universal experience—as it is represented by artists who are themselves facing immanent death. The unique and deeply personal process of each dying artist is crucially informed by social, cultural and historical as well as artistic contexts. The course will focus primarily on visual artists and writers living with and dying of disease—such as AIDS, cancer and cystic fibrosis—as well as mortality and age.  Topics such as aesthetics, artistic media, representation, grief, bereavement, illness, care-giving, aging, and the dying process will be considered within the context of issues of race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, gender and community values.  Some of the artists covered will be Jo Spence, Hannah Wilke, Elias Canetti, Bob Flanagan, Herve Guibert, Tom Joslin, Laurie Lynd, Audre Lorde, Charlotte Salomon, Keith Haring, Frida Kahlo, Bas Jan Ader, Ted Rosenthal, Felix Gonzalez Torres, Keith Haring, Eric Steel, Derek Jarman, Eric Michaels, and David Wojnarowicz.

CLA,HIST,103,103161,The City in History,"This course offers an introduction to the study of history by exploring the history of a particular city. Cities are complicated places, where many peoples, cultures, and histories overlap and interact. Their histories are also shaped by many forces, such as economic, cultural, demographic, social, and sexual, operating at levels from local to national to global. Studying a city offers a window into the history of a local place as well as a nation. The choice of the city is left up to the individual professor.

CLA,HIST,125,201041,Public History and Public Debate,"In late 1994, the B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay —the airplane that dropped the first atomic bomb detonated in combat on Hiroshima, Japan—arrived at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. The museum’s staff faced important questions: would they celebrate the Enola Gay as the weapon that ended the Pacific War? Would they exhibit it as a technological artifact that marked the dawn of nuclear warfare? Would they remind museum visitors that its potent cargo ended the lives of tens of thousands of people? These were difficult professional questions for public historians; they were deeply ethical questions too.

Much of the past that public historians interpret is the source of great debate in the present. Since the way history is remembered shapes public policy, community identity, and collective understanding, the ethical stakes for public history are high. This course will examine notable controversies in American public history and develop students’ critical perspectives on them. Students will generate answers to the questions: What are the ethics of doing public history? What happens when public historians remember, but the community wants to forget? When stakeholders (e.g., historic site, community, historians, sponsors) collide, whose stories and whose interests prevail? Who decides? How are those decisions made? Who is allowed to tell history? To whom or to what are public historians responsible?",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,HIST,160,103111,History of Modern East Asia,"Understanding the history of East Asia is integral to understanding the complex world that we live in, and will help us to understand that no single nation can live in isolation.  One cannot endeavor to understand limited national entities alone; rather one must understand the interactions between cultures and across borders that help to define the world.  Japan, for example, cannot be adequately understood without reference to China, Korea, and one might argue, the wider world.  Therefore, we will undertake in this course to examine the region of East Asia historically from about 1600 to the present, paying special attention to interactions between the cultures and people of the region.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,

These idealized depictions mask a far more complicated and richer historical reality of the development of family structures in the U.S. This course will examine both the diverse experiences of actual families in the American past, and changing ideologies about the family and its social role.

It takes a comparative approach, exploring the histories of deaf people from around the globe, including deaf lives in Central America, Europe, Africa, and East Asia. Special attention will be given to the major events in European deaf history, as Europe was the site for the first schools for the deaf in the history of the world, and the world's first documented deaf culture, in France, emerged there as well. The spread of deaf education, the rise of indigenous signed languages, the birth of deaf-hood, and the fight for human rights will all be placed in a global context.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,HIST,238,113829,History of Disability,"This course will explore the meaning of disability in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The course provides a cultural over-view of disability and seeks to explore the social construction of disability, with special attention given to the cultural, intellectu-al, personal, and social histories of disability. Disability in history has been many (frequently contradictory) things: acquired at birth and acquired by war; a reason to promote eugenic policies or a reason to promote civil rights legislation; a medical diagnosis or a personal identity; visible in the body (as in the case of amputations) or invisible (as in the case of deafness); a source of family shame or a source of personal pride. How has the meaning and nature of disability changed over time? How can we understand the cultural meaning of the body in history? The course seeks to explore and explain these shifting meanings of disabil-ity within the context of Western history. Specific topics to be considered include freak shows, disabled veterans, prosthetic technologies, disability as culture, the history of eugenics, and political activism.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,

Students will be able to trace the relationship to the Chinese to various non-Chinese peoples, particularly the semi-nomadic peoples on the northern frontier.  Students will also examine the way that Chin's long and complicated past has shaped its present, and how its relations to other peoples has shaped its modern relations to both its neighbors and the west.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,HIST,261,103113,History of Modern China,"China occupies a rather large place in the consciousness of most Americas.  It is the most populous country in the world, it has one of the biggest economies in the world and, in many ways, China has been seen to be in direct competition with America.  Whatever the truth of these ideas, it is clear that China will play a major role on the world stage for the foreseeable future.  This class will seek to analyze the historical circumstances surrounding the rise of modern China.  What were the conditions that led to the establishment of, first, Nationalist China, followed by the People's Republic; why did the communist government enjoy such popular support; what were China's relations with the outside world; and finally, what is the state of China today?

CLA,HIST,275,200453,Screening the Trenches: The History of WWI Through Film,"This course uses popular films to examine World War I as the global conflict that set the stage for the rise of communism, fascism, and subsequent wars in twentieth-century Europe. Students will gain an understanding of the major causes and outcomes of World War I while investigating how the war transformed class, gender, and racial politics in Europe. Special attention will be paid to the combat/trench experience, the home front/war front divide, the German occupation of Belgium and Northern France, “total war,” the politics of shell-shock and disability, and the legacies of grief, mourning, and commemoration. Because World War I so greatly divided its participants, little consensus about the war’s meaning emerged in its aftermath. Filmmakers have consequently used World War I as a “blank slate” on which to project political fantasies, condemn elements of their own societies, or imagine the future. Students will use secondary historical literature and original primary sources to analyze filmic representations of World War I and consider how filmmakers have deliberately misrepresented the past or constructed particular narratives about the war to serve their own ends. This course will therefore equip students to think critically about representations of the historical past in popular culture.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,

The trans-Atlantic slave trade was the world's largest forced migration between continents, but it was only one of many slave trades that shaped societies throughout the world. In order to understand the historical significance of global slave trades, we will compare it to other systems of slavery. In examining the historical significance and legacies of the slave trade, we will link different regional histories to the growth of market-based capitalist economies into the twentieth century. The course will also examine the changing meaning of the term ‘slavery’ and examine some modern forms of forced labor, bondage, and slavery that persist to this day in all sectors of the global economy.

CLA,HIST,326,114433,Doing History in a Digital World,"Digital history is a nebulous concept, but at its core is a recognition that the widespread availability of computers and their networks has fundamentally altered the way history is produced and consumed.  Sources in digital format simultaneously present opportunities and challenges that force us to rethink what is possible in history.  Digital tools including blogs, wikis, video sharing sites, and many others help bring history to new audiences in different ways.  In this course, we will investigate the landscape of digital history and tackle the exciting task of creating and understanding history in the digital age.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,HIST,330,114432,Deafness and Technology,"The deaf community has a long and complicated relationship with technological devices. The deaf community, for instance, was quick to embrace the new technology of moving pictures, and many deaf actors found work in early Hollywood during the silent film era. Most lost their livelihoods when sound was introduced to motion pictures. Deaf people were left out of the communication revolution brought about by the telephone for many years, but now the deaf community is increasingly a wired community, as texting, tweeting, and blogging makes more communication technologies accessible to deaf users. This course will explore the historical relationship between technology and deafness. It will consider how views of deafness frequently shape technology, that is, if deafness is viewed as a pathological illness, technologies are focused on curing it (e.g., cochlear implants), whereas, if deaf people are viewed as members of linguistic and cultural minority, technologies are harnessed to make it easier for that minority to interact with the majority culture (e.g, relay systems). It will consider how deaf people have used, created, and adopted technologies to their own ends. It will also explore the complicated, and controversial, relationship between Deaf people and medical technologies such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, and in vitro fertilization (IVF).",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,

CLA,HIST,335,114428,Women and the Deaf Community,"Deaf history, as a field, has often neglected the story of deaf women. Scholar Arlene B. Kelly has recently asked, Where is deaf herstory?  This course seeks to correct that gender imbalance in deaf history. We will study deaf women's history. This will include a consideration of deaf-blind women, as well, as women like Helen Keller were often the most famous deaf women of their era. But this course also seeks to look at the role of hearing women in deaf history. Hearing women dominated the field of deaf education in the late nineteenth century. They had a tremendous impact on the lives of deaf children and the events of deaf educational history. Hearing women were also important figures in deaf history as mothers. As mothers of deaf children, hearing women were frequently asked to behave as teachers in the home. Their embrace of this role often led them to endorse oral education, and oppose the sign language. Hearing mothers in this way were pitted against their adult deaf daughters, who frequently went on to learn sign language against their mothers' wishes. The historically complex relationship between women and the deaf community will be explored in this course.",LEC,,,FALL,3,,,,,,,,,,,

CLA,HIST,365,200783,Conflict in Modern East Asia,"The twentieth century has sometimes been called the Pacific Century, which is ironic since this period of time has been anything but pacific!  The twentieth century saw the rise of four great pacific powers; the US, Japan, China and the Soviet Union, and saw the eclipse of several others, including the British and French Empires.  Furthermore a major front of the Cold War was played out on the Asian continent, namely the Korean and Vietnam wars, as well as the US standoff with Communist China.  And of course the Second World War, the greatest concentrated period of human destruction, played out at the midpoint of the twentieth century.  This class will analyze these conflicts both as conflicts in and of themselves, but will also look at the backdrop against which these conflicts were played out.  Beginning with the subjugation of China in the 19th century, our class will examine the many conflicts that defined this region through the end of the twentieth century.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,
CLA,HIST,369,109455,Histories of Christianity,"The history of Christianity is not simply the history of the religion of the west.  Rather, Christian history is a long and complex movement that has profoundly affected Asia, Africa, Europe, and the New World. At various times there were several competing ideologies of Christianity, of which the west's was only a single example.  Christianity also has a long history of interacting with other religions, from Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism to Judaism and Islam.  This course will trace the development of Christianity paying special attention to how the Christian tradition developed in places such as Africa and Asia.  We will, of course, also study Christianity in its western forms, but we will make an effort to dive into the rich tradition of this religion in all its many forms.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,

CLA,HIST,381,200822,Technology in the Modern World,"Trains, planes, automobiles, phones and computers – modern technologies like these make our daily lives pleasant and convenient. Yet, many people around the globe lack access to these technologies. In this course, we will investigate the emergence of industrial manufacturing processes in late 18th century Britain that allowed for the development of these technologies. We will also examine how new technologies spread to other places in the world, how they shaped colonial relations, and what role they play in today’s developing world. In this course, you will gain a better understanding of how people around the world have shaped their technologies, and how technologies in turn have shaped them.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,

CLA,HIST,430,201245,Deaf Spaces,"History, and particularly Deaf history within a predominantly hearing world, is the product of a vast network of inter-related spaces, in which more or less well-defined knowledges and cultures are performed. This course will provide students the opportunity to learn skills to identify and describe the different spaces - produced by both Deaf and hearing people - that have contributed to a 'history of the Deaf community'. It will equip students with the ability to not only identify and describe the histories of the Deaf community, but also to critically explore the meta-historical narratives that shape those histories, allowing them to situate those narratives within the wider evolution of social and cultural representation.

CLA,HIST,439,110650,Biography as History,"This course will look at biography as a form of history. By studying biographies that approach their subjects with various formats and methods of presentation, the class will examine how the craft of biography shapes our contemporary understanding of the historical past. Among the questions to be examined in this course are: how does biography reveal the historical circumstances of the subject’s life to give readers a broader understanding of the historical context of that life? How effectively can contemporary readers explore the past through the prism of one person’s life? Can the history of an era be effectively told through an examination of one person’s life? What are the benefits of the biographical approach to history? What are the drawbacks?  What are the benefits of biography as a form of public history? That is, when people can get their history through the Biography Channel, how important is it for public historians to grapple with the impact of biography as a form with a unique grip on the public imagination?",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,

CLA,HIST,462,200774,East-West Encounters,"The Age of Discovery, beginning in the fifteenth century and culminating with the advent of European imperialism, is one of the most fascinating, as well as problematic, periods in the history of both Asia and Europe.  Too often historians frame the interaction between Asia and Europe in uniquely European terms and present Asia as a passive partner in this process of discovery.  In fact, this period presents us with a number of complex issues such as national identity, the nature of European expansion, and the Asian response to European journeys to the East. This course will undertake to re-examine the age of discovery not only from a European point of view, but also from an Asian standpoint.  In the process, we will see how many of the issues that we are facing in the region are products of a long and complex relationship between Europe and Asia.  Students will also examine the issues that have arisen between the east and the west in the twentieth century and that continue into our own time.",LEC,,,FALL-SPRNG,3,,,,,,,,,,,

CLA,HIST,470,200455,"Science, Tech, & European Imperialism: 1800-1965","Between 1800 and 1945, Western nations dominated approximately three-quarters of the earth’s surface through imperialism. This course examines how industrialization, technological developments, and the emergence of the modern “sciences” facilitated Europe’s conquest and colonization of vast territories overseas. The course opens with a brief overview of the role of biology and science in shaping early imperial encounters (the Columbian Exchange). Students will then consider how 19th-century botany, zoology, acclimatization, cartography, geography, and anthropology became “imperial” sciences that facilitated formal conquest by producing knowledge about distant cultures, “races,” and environments. The Industrial Revolution produced new technological “tools”--steamboats, railroads, and weapons--that facilitated the “Scramble” for territory in the late 19th century. The course will consider how these inventions shaped patterns of conquest and colonial rule in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Throughout the course, students will interrogate how Europeans’ faith in the superiority of Western technology, scientific knowledge, and medicine shaped the evolution of the European “civilizing mission”-- the cultural and political logic that defined interactions between Europeans and non-Western populations. At the same time, they will evaluate how Africans and Asians experienced living under colonial rule, and in some cases, how they deployed Western technology as weapons of resistance to imperialism.",LEC,,,SPRING,3,,,,,,,,,,,

Programmers in Bangalore or Chennay now write software for US companies, and doctors in India or Australia interpret the Cat-Scan or MRI images of US patients overnight. As bestselling author Thomas Friedman argues, “the world is flat,” that is competition for intellectual work is now global. Others have suggested that information technologies have led to global homogenization, with people around the world reading the same news, listening to the same music, and purchasing the same products.

Spanning the globe, as nearly limitless omnivores, humans have developed myriad ways of collecting and cultivating food and taking advantage of local environments.  We also put food to work for us socially by creating cuisine. Through cuisine, we forge and nourish relationships, commune with deities, and through luxury choices, demonstrate our ""taste"" and lay claim to elite status. Through the cultural practices of production and consumption of food and drink, we wield power. Food and drink consumption patterns have sustained slavery, poverty, malnutrition, and illegal immigration, and have laid waste to the environment.

The trans-Atlantic slave trade was the world's largest forced migration between continents, but it was only one of many slave trades that shaped societies throughout the world. In order to understand the historical significance of global slave trades, we will compare it to other systems of slavery. In examining the historical significance and legacies of the slave trade, we will link different regional histories to the growth of market-based capitalist economies into the twentieth century. The course will also examine the changing meaning of the term ‘slavery’ and examine some modern forms of forced labor, bondage, and slavery that persist to this day in all sectors of the global economy.

Writing about society and culture is also poetic. We can convey something of people's life experiences, thoughts, agency, and the constraints within which they lead their lives.

CLA,WGST,335,114428,Women and the Deaf Community,"Deaf history, as a field, has often neglected the story of deaf women. Scholar Arlene B. Kelly has recently asked, Where is deaf herstory?  This course seeks to correct that gender imbalance in deaf history. We will study deaf women's history. This will include a consideration of deaf-blind women, as well, as women like Helen Keller were often the most famous deaf women of their era. But this course also seeks to look at the role of hearing women in deaf history. Hearing women dominated the field of deaf education in the late nineteenth century. They had a tremendous impact on the lives of deaf children and the events of deaf educational history. Hearing women were also important figures in deaf history as mothers. As mothers of deaf children, hearing women were frequently asked to behave as teachers in the home. Their embrace of this role often led them to endorse oral education, and oppose the sign language. Hearing mothers in this way were pitted against their adult deaf daughters, who frequently went on to learn sign language against their mothers' wishes.

Drawing from and reflecting on approaches to women's and gender studies from a variety of disciplines and cultures, we will use these theoretical lenses to read social, cultural, and artistic texts and cultural practices in a new light.  How do cultural texts and practices (such as novels, graphic novels, plastic surgery, invitro fertilization, music videos, bulimia, facebook, video games, advertising, etc.) encourage us to think about gender, sex, sexuality, race, class, nation, transnation, science and power?  What role do they play in processes of identity formation? How do power-laden ideas of gender, sexuality, race and class travel from culture to culture or refuse an easy translation?  What old and new discourses of gender, sex, sexuality, race, colonialism, or biopower do these texts help in, or resist disseminating?  How has women's and gender studies and the creative, activist and academic practices theorized in this multidisciplinary, global space, challenged gendered and racialized power structures in the past, in the present, and how might it transform its methods to confront current challenges?  What connections can be drawn between women around the world without erasing their distinct differences?
