back to the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the time will be dedicated to
artists of the last three decades. We will examine texts that propose art to be a
form of activism and persuade artists to be responsible for the way they represent the world-and maybe even determine if the goal of art is not to represent
it in the first place. The artists we will discuss are concerned with problems in
our society that affect gender, race, sexuality, poverty, labor issues, and the
environment. (Contemporary Art) Credit 3

Pan-Indian Native American Literature
This course examines Native American literature from the end of the Indian
Wars, as demarcated by the massacre at Wounded Knee, through the relocation and termination eras to just before the Native-American Renaissance.
During these years, we witness the emergence of a pan-Indian identity that
results in part from colonial policies, such as boarding schools, and results in
intertribal political coalitions, such as the Society for American Indians. This
course focuses upon the literatures generated from this shift in Native consciousness and asks students to consider issues of identity formation. Part of

Autobiography
According to poet James Merrill, we live in the age of “me-moir,” at least in
American culture. But what happens to the quarrel between truth and fiction,
to the forms of language and self-representation, as we move outside of
England and America? In this course, we will explore the history and assumptions of traditional autobiographical writing, particularly in the past two centuries. We will examine a rich spectrum of life-writings, ranging from formal
autobiography to “outlaw” narratives, including selections from diaries, journals and visual self portraits in art, photography and film. In these works, we
will trace new modes of constructing identity as we redefine the boundaries
of family, nation, class and gender. Part of the literary and cultural studies

Contemporary Native American Literature
the year 1968 marks the beginning of an era referred to by Kenneth Lincoln as
the “Native American Renaissance.” Beginning with the publication of Scott
Momaday’s “House Made of Dawn,” we begin to see the emergence of a substantial body of texts commonly recognized by dominant standards as a “literature.” This course seeks to contextualize these late 20th century works in
their individual tribal and larger pan-Indian traditions, noting the earlier literary traditions that inform them. We will consider texts commonly conceived
of as “metropolitan,” as well as those that firmly reject mainstream expectations of literature. Part of the literary and cultural studies concentration and

Native American Women’s Experience
This course examines the unique status of Native American women in tribal
and Euroamerican societies. Given the gender complementary construction of
many tribal communities, Native women long enjoyed a status and power not
found in Europe, but this equality has been altered in many tribes as a result
of colonialism. We will study how Native women have responded to assaults
on the “feminine principle,” as Paula Gunn Allen terms it, and how they have
sought to rebuild tribal communities along the lines of traditional values. We
will examine the following themes in Native women’s lives: tribal gender
roles, nation, community, family, class, work, race, sexuality, disability, culture-bearing, environment, land, health, and representation. Part of the literary and cultural studies concentration and minor. May also be taken as an

Maps, Spaces, and Places
“Space speaks!” This course shifts the modernist focus on time to the dynamics of space and place. We begin with a meditation on the language of maps
and mapmaking, exploring through films, art and literary texts the paradox
that in order to present a useful picture, an accurate map must tell lies.
Among our questions: How do certain interests come to be embodied in mapmaking? How do literary works imaginatively construct space? Do mapmaking and power mutually reinforce various kinds of social authority, but deny
others? How can we begin to think about race, class, gender and sexuality,
and Western culture in terms of the authority asserted in space and spatial
configurations? Critical readings will include the work of cultural geographers, cartographers, but focus primarily on novelists, filmmakers, memoirists and poets. Part of the literary and cultural studies concentration and
minor. May also be taken as an elective. (0502-227 or equivalent) Class 4,

colonial era to the present day. From the New England transcendentalists of
the 19th century to the pragmatism and neopragmatism of the 20th and 21st,
American philosophy has responded to the demands of a pluralistic, everchanging society. Because American philosophy is a reflection of American
culture, it has also offered a unique perspective on perennial philosophical
problems in ways that have differed sharply from dominant forms of

Minds and Machines
Present and potential technological developments in artificial intelligence and
artificial life pose a variety of challenges to traditional accounts of intelligence,
life, and personhood. Is the mind a machine? Can machines think? Could artifacts deserve moral consideration? What would happen if machines evolved
into the most intelligent and capable beings on the planet? Is it possible for
“life” and “mind” to emerge out of a wholly material evolutionary process?

Cultural anthropology is the study of cultural diversity and cultural change.
Anthroplogists use techniques of immersion to gain a close, insider’s view of
a culture. Anthropological research addresses some of the most prominent
and pressing social issues of our time, including international migration, mass
media, changing views of gender and sexuality, racism, tourism, religious
fundamentalism, ethnic nationalism, war and genocide, hunger and famine,
and the globalization of popular culture. This course introduces cultural
anthropology and each year it may focus on a different topic. Fulfills a liberal
arts core social/behavioral science requirement. Counts as the prerequisite for

Cultures in Globalization
Change in all subsystems of human culture is the norm on the planet earth as
its human inhabitants begin the 21st century and a new millennium. In particular, the stress and strain that accompany change challenge traditional lifeways among both tribal and peasant societies in the developing world. The
change is driven by many factors including global and local population
growth and by the expanding world capitalist system through which technology is transferred and the culture of consumption is spread to the most
remote corners of the globe. This course presents an anthropological perspective in which both historical and cross-cultural approaches to study of cultural
dynamics are emphasized. Required course for international studies majors.
Part of the sociology/anthropology and Latino/Latina/Latin American concentrations; the sociology/anthropology minor; and may also be taken as an

Native North Americans
The resilience of Native North Americans continues to amaze anthropologists
and those who once proclaimed them certain for extinction. What can now be
acclaimed as a remarkable revival of dead Indians, these cultures are rich and
thriving. They maintain their world views but in a drastically changed and contemporary setting. Many tribes own casinos, hotels, resorts, and other successful
businesses. Not only are the values and their heritage alive and well, they are
quite successful in reviving the formerly outlawed traditions of the past such as
potlatch, medicine lodge, and ghost dance. This course is taught from a Native
American perspective and addresses both past and current issues that affect
their culture, heritage, and tribal sovereignty. Part of the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor. May also be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4
0510-447
Anthropology of Mass Media
This course examines the cultural importance of mass media in different societies. By analyzing the flow of media images across national borders, emphasis is given to the local impact of media culture in different parts of the world.
How, for example, do mass media represent and shape the cultural values
and beliefs in developing societies? What is the role of mass media in forging
national and ethnic identities, body images, sexuality and gender, and the
experience of war and violence in western and non-western societies? Part of
the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor. May also be taken as
an elective. Class 4, Credit 4

Native Americans in Film
From visions of romantic fantasy to imagery of the barbaric and horrific, Native
Americans have been misrepresented in film since the invention of motion pictures. Tonto, Pocahontas, Hiawatha, and how the west was won: How do you
know what is real and what is imagined? This course examines the genre of
Native American films and intends to critically analyze stereotypes, false
imagery, and how these have infatuated even the most educated of viewers.
While anthropologists studied diligently among Native Americans, they too fed
Hollywood the embellished images that dominate the big screen. We will identify the roles anthropologists have played in the emergence and correction of
these Native American stereotypes. Part of the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor. May also be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4

Introduction to Archaeology
Archaeology is the study of the human past, from the origin of our species
through to the development of modern, industrial states. In studying the past,
archaeology seeks to explain how we, as modern humans, came to be. This
course discusses how archaeologists study the past and explain how human
society has changed over time, and present an overview of world prehistory,
examining key developments in the human past. Specific topics will include
the evolution of modern humans, the peopling of the world, the development
of agriculture, the rise of states, and the development of urban society. Case
studies will be used throughout to demonstrate how archaeological research
is conducted and how archaeologists use their research to formulate explanations of the past that have relevance for the present. Part of the sociology/
anthropology concentration and minor. May also be taken as an elective.
Class 4, Credit 4

Great Discoveries in Archaeology
Archaeology conjures a romantic image in the minds of many people and
almost everyone is at least familiar with some of the greatest discoveries made
by archaeologists. Finds such as King Tut’s tomb, the ancient city of Troy, the
jungle cities of the Maya, and Otzi the ice man, excite almost anyone who
hears of them. But what is it, aside from fabulous wealth, romantic locale, or
incredible preservation that makes them great? Although great discoveries
are always exciting, archaeology is not only about finding things, but also
about using these findings to explain the human past. This course helps us
understand how and why human society has changed over time. It explores
some of the great discoveries of archaeology, many of which will be familiar
to students. Part of the sociology/anthropology concentration and may also
be taken as an elective. (0510-502) Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)
0510-507
Archaeological Science
Archaeology is one of the few social sciences that lends itself well to the application of analytical techniques from the physical sciences. This is largely due
to the fact that archaeology relies primarily on physical evidence. Physical science techniques can yield powerful insights into daily life in past societies.
This course examines the growing field of archaeological science. The course
covers a number of archaeological questions including the age and origin of
materials; how things are made; what people ate; their daily activities; their
state of health; and how archaeological scientists are able to answer these
questions using techniques from biology, chemistry, and physics. The course
includes in-class labs in which students apply some of these techniques and a
final research project in which the student picks their own archaeological
question and methodology to answer it. Part of the sociology/anthropology
concentration and minor. May also be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4

Benefit-Cost Analysis
Explores the use and abuse of benefit-cost and related analytical techniques
commonly encountered in economic policy making. Many expenditure and
regulatory programs of governmental agencies now are routinely evaluated in
a benefit-cost or cost-effectiveness framework, and debate about policy decisions increasingly draws upon benefit-cost findings. Yet, application of benefitcost analysis often attracts much controversy, in part because of disagreements
about how to conduct such analysis and about the role that economic efficiency
should play in societal decisions. The mechanics, power and limitations of this
form of analysis form the primary elements of the course. Required course for

Game Theory with Economic Applications
Game theory uses a mathematical approach to study situations with two or
more players in which each player’s decision influences payoffs of other players. We will start with a short introduction on single person decision theory,
and then study how to formulate multiperson decisions problems as game
theoretic models; how to predict behavior (through the use of various equilibrium concepts) of the parties involved and/or identify guide lines for appropriate behavior. The concepts and methods will be illustrated with many
examples from economics and business. Game theoretic methodology is
widely used in economics, and hence the skills learned in this course will be
very useful to both those who want to study further and those who plan to
look for consulting jobs. Part of the economics concentration and minor. May

independent, experimental research expertise. Students are guided by faculty
advisors in conducting experimental research on an issue of their choice.
Students design the method, run subjects, and analyze the results of their
study. Students write up the project in APA format. Passing this write-up
qualifies the students for the writing requirement in psychology. Because
Senior Project is the culmination of a student’s scientific research learning
experience in the psychology major, it is expected that the project will be
somewhat novel, will extend the theoretical understanding of their previous
work (or of the previous work of another researcher), and go well beyond any
similar projects that they might have done in any of their previous courses.

1029-503
Polymer Chemistry: Properties of Bulk Materials
This course is designed to give the student with a chemistry or materials science background a thorough grounding in the main concepts that describe
bulk polymer structure, behavior and properties. The course follows a synthetic path; the structure-property relationships for polymeric materials are
built up from a microscopic to a macroscopic level. One of the most important
lessons of the course is that polymers are almost never in a thermodynamically stable state. Consequently, the behavior of polymers and the properties
they display are time dependent and vary with the thermo-mechanical history
of the materials. (1029-501, 502) Class 4, Credit 4 (F-X*)
1029-504

each requiring eight lab hours to complete, are designed to give students
exposure to laboratory techniques not generally covered in undergraduate
science/engineering curriculum. Although the documentation of experimental results is important, and will be evaluated, the main purpose is to give the
student hands-on experience, hopefully piquing his/her interest in and
enthusiasm for the field. (1008-319, 1029-301) Lab 6, Credit 2 (offered alternate years; offered 2003-04) (S)

Aikido
Aikido was founded by Master Morihei Uyeshiba as a synthesis primarily of
Aiki-jitsu, Aiki-ken, Judo and founder’s philosophy of peaceful reconciliation
of conflict. One of the founder’s students, Koichi Tohei Sensei, founded a
branch school called the Ki-Society, which emphasizes the development of
personal “ki” through Aikido practice. RIT Aikido traces its lineage back to
the original Hombu dojo in Japan. The objective of this course is to provide
physical conditioning by educating and coordinating the whole body-mindspirit system. Basic ideas and techniques will be taught. The four basic principles to be presented: “Keep one-point,” “Relax completely,” “Keep weight
underside,” and “Extend Ki.” A course fee applies. (F, W, S)
1113-061
Aikido: Bokken and Jo
Aikido: “Bokken and Jo” places an emphasis of the study of Aikido in a learning movement, timing and extending “ki” through an outside wooden object
(the bokken or jo), as opposed to a “regular” Aikido class where students learn
movement, timing and extending “ki” through themselves in response to being
physically attacked. The bokken and jo are weapons only in a traditional sense,
not in a 21st century sense. A course in bokken and jo would actually be safer
than the regular class in that no contact is allowed at all, and most of the study
involves “kata” (a series of movements that a student does on his/her own,
similar to a dance). The course would only be open to those who have previously taken Aikido (or an equivalent), as this is an advanced class. No mats are
needed for this class. It is a highly disciplined, mentally challenging activity.
There is a course fee. Please check SIS for more detailed quarterly information
(Offered periodically depending on instructor/facility availability).
