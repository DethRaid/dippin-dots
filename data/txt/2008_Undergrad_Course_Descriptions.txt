Survey of Western Art and Architecture
The subject of this course is the history of Western art and architecture, from
prehistoric times to circa 1950. We will examine the form, style, function and
meaning of important monuments of the past and consider these in their historical and cultural context. We will approach these objects in chronological
order, for students first need to learn when, where and by whom (whether a
people or a known individual) a given object was produced before they can
attempt to determine why the object was made, what it meant in its time and
place (as opposed to what it may mean to us today), and whose ideology it
served. Once we know how to classify visual information, we may be able to
make historical sense of the surviving evidence. Credit 3

This course examines the widely influential mid-1960s art movement that
questioned the fundamental nature of art itself by renunciating the material
art object as well as the phenomenon of art making. The definition of art as
well as its institutional framework was thereby expanded, and the idea, concept or intellectual dimension of the work was underscored. Students will be

global movement across a wide spectrum of works and practices (paintings,
performance, installations, books and texts, photography, film and video) and
its relevance to contemporary concerns. Credit 3

2039-452
Art and Activism
This course will focus on artists using their work for the purpose of changing society. Students will consider work by both individual artists and artists
working in groups that cause critics, art historians, other artists and the viewing public to ask if what they are doing is art. Although there will be forays
back to the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the time will be dedicated
to artists of the last three decades. We will examine texts that propose art to
be a form of activism and persuade artists to be responsible for the way they
represent the world and maybe even determine if the goal of art is not to represent it in the first place. The artists we discuss are concerned with problems
in our society that affect gender, race, sexuality, poverty, labor issues and the
environment. (2039-225, 226, and 227) Credit 3

the same language do so in such a different way and how the way we talk
marks our identity in society. How did British and American English get to be
so different? Are New Yorkers really street smart and Southerners really laid
back, or is that just a stereotype associated with their dialects? Why does language change to begin with? In addition to regional dialects, we will look at
how language use varies based on social factors such as race, ethnicity, gender
and social class. We will also consider sign language, language in politics, language in advertising, bilingualism, Spanish in the U.S., and such heated topics

Science Fiction
Isn’t the term “science fiction” a paradox, an oxymoron? I mean science is
real, verifiable and ‘true,’ right? And fiction is, well, fiction. This course will
look at the intersections of art and science in literature, film and perhaps other
media. Science and fiction engage in many ways, and the two have allowed
for mutual reflection, analysis and generative engagement for quite some
time. We will consider how and why narrative and artistic modes of expression serve to make science “public” and how the two “cultures,” as C.P Snow
has famously described the realms of Art and Science, can and do shape one
another. Part of writing studies concentration and minor and literary and
cultural studies minor and science writing minor; may be taken as an elective.

Autobiography
According to poet James Merrill, we live in the age of “me-moir,” at least in
American culture. But what happens to the quarrel between truth and fiction, to the forms of language and self-representation, as we move outside
of England and America? In this course, we will explore the history and
assumptions of traditional autobiographical writing, particularly in the past
two centuries. We will examine a rich spectrum of life writings, ranging from
formal autobiography to “outlaw” narratives, including selections from diaries, journals and visual self-portraits in art, photography and film. In these
works, we will trace new modes of constructing identity as we redefine the
boundaries of family, nation, class and gender. Part of the literary and cultural
studies concentration and minor; may also be taken as an elective. (0502-227

Native American Women’s Experience
This course examines the unique status of Native American women in tribal
and Euroamerican societies. Given the gender complementary construction of
many tribal communities, Native women long enjoyed a status and power not
found in Europe, but this equality has been altered in many tribes as a result
of colonialism. We will study how Native women have responded to assaults
on the “feminine principle,” as Paula Gunn Allen terms it. We will examine
the following themes in Native women’s lives: tribal gender roles, nation,
community, family, class, work, race, sexuality, disability, culture-bearing,
environment, land, health and representation. Part of the literary and cultural
studies concentration and minor; may also be taken as an elective. Cross-listed

Pan-Indian Native American Literature
This course examines Native American literature from the end of the Indian
Wars, as demarcated by the massacre at Wounded Knee, through the relocation and termination eras to just before the Native American Renaissance.
During these years, we witness the emergence of a pan-Indian identity that
results in part from colonial policies, such as boarding schools, and results in
intertribal political coalitions, such as the Society for American Indians. This
course focuses on the literatures generated from this shift in Native consciousness and asks students to consider issues of identity formation. Part of the
literary and cultural studies concentration and minor; may also be taken as an
elective. (0502-227 or equivalent) Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)

Early Native American Narrative
The year 1968 marks the beginning of an era referred to by Kenneth Lincoln as
the “Native American Renaissance.” Beginning with the publication of Scott
Momaday’s House Made of Dawn, we begin to see the emergence of a substantial body of texts commonly recognized by dominant standards as a “literature.” This course seeks to centextualize these late 20th century works in their
individual tribal and larger pan-Indian traditions, noting the earlier literary
traditions that inform them. We will consider texts commonly conceived of
as “metropolitan” as well as those that firmly reject mainstream expectations
of literature. Part of the literary and cultural studies concentration and minor;
may also be taken as an elective. (0502-227 or equivalent) Class 4, Credit 4

Environmental Philosophy
A variety of decision procedures may be and have been used to determine
what to do regarding environmental issues. Each alternative can determine
what is reasonable and moral, and assessing them presents theoretical problems. We examine each in terms of morality, examine their presuppositions
and consequences, determine whether we can assess them and, if so, how.
Students begin to learn to be conscious of and assess the decision procedures
that are often buried in policy recommendations regarding particular environmental problems. Part of the public policy degree program; the philosophy
concentration and minor; may also be taken as an elective. Part of the environmental studies minor. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered at least once every two years)
0509-454
Feminist Theory
This course explores the nature and effects of categories of sex and gender
upon our ways of living, thinking and doing, while also challenging how
gendered assumptions might shape our conceptions of identity and inquiry
more generally. Different conceptions of sex and gender will be discussed,
and the course will investigate how these concepts affect our lives in both
concrete and symbolic ways. Special attention will be paid to how gendered
assumptions color our understanding of knowledge production, experiences
of embodiment and emotion, public and private activities, and the nature of
ethical decision making. Part of the philosophy concentration and minor; may
also be taken as an elective. (One prior course in philosophy recommended)

This course examines the history of modern philosophy from Descartes
through Kant. This period marked the beginning of modern science, with a
rich ferment of ideas, and the philosophy of the period is essential to understanding modern science as well as contemporary problems about consciousness, mind/body interaction, causation, and so on. Questions to be considered
in this course include the following: What is the scope and what are the limits
of our knowledge? What is the nature of reality? Do we have access to reality?
How is causal interaction possible, if at all? Does God exist, and if so, how do
we know and what relation does God have to the world? Part of the philosophy concentration and minor; may also be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit
4 (offered at least once every two years)
0509-458
Philosophy of Mind
The philosophy of mind is a fairly large category. It includes issues of metaphysics, epistemology, logic, psychology, aesthetics, linguistics, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and biology, to name a few. Here are some typical
questions that writers in the philosophy of mind often find interesting: Is there
an ontological difference between minds and bodies? Could there be minds
without bodies? Can I know that I have a mind? Are there other minds in

American Philosophy
This course examines the contributions of American philosophers from the
colonial era to the present day. From the New England transcendentalists
of the 19th century to the pragmatism and neo-pragmatism of the 20th and
21st, American philosophy has responded to the demands of a pluralistic, ever-changing society. Because American philosophy is a reflection of
American culture, it has also offered a unique perspective on perennial philosophical problems in ways that have differed sharply from dominant forms
of European philosophy. Authors may include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry
David Thoreau, Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, C.S. Peirce, Jane
Addams, William James, Black Elk, John Dewey and Richard Rorty. Part of the

way its meaning is created through actions and choices. Existentialism focuses
on the concept of individual freedom in an effort to respond authentically
to the possibilities that life presents, emphasizing the importance of certain
psychological states (e.g., anxiety, anticipation of death, fear, care, responsibility and hope) and extreme situations in bringing us to an awareness of our
radical freedom. This course will consider such philosophers and writers as

0509-472
Minds and Machines
Present and potential technological developments in artificial intelligence
and artificial life pose a variety of challenges to traditional accounts of intelligence, life and personhood. Is the mind a machine? Can machines think?
Could artifacts deserve moral consideration? What would happen if machines
evolved into the most intelligent and capable beings on the planet? Is it possible for “life” and “mind” to emerge out of a wholly material evolutionary
process? This course will address these issues drawing from resources in the
philosophy of mind and the philosophy of technology. Part of the philosophy
concentration and minor; may also be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4
(offered at least once every two years)
0509-473
Technology and Embodiment
This course investigates how technological practices and inventions can
suggest new ideas for conceptualizing how the body works, what the body
is fundamentally, and what the body can, as well as should, become. By
critically examining different conceptions of embodiment as well as different
technologies that mediate our embodied relation to the world, we will enrich
our understanding of the nature and scope of agency and identity. Part of the
philosophy concentration and minor; may also be taken as an elective. Class
4, Credit 4 (offered at least once every two years)
0509-474
Philosophy of Language
This course examines how philosophers and others have understood the
nature of language. It explores the classical philosophical contexts in metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics and rhetoric in which concerns about the nature of
language arose. In addition, the course focuses on recent debates within both
contemporary analytic and continental traditions of philosophy. Some likely
areas of inquiry will be: theories of reference, description and naming; theories
of meaning, metaphor and narrative; functionalist, pragmatist and naturalist
accounts; structuralist, post-structuralist and hermeneutic accounts, among
others. The prominence of one or the other of these debates and approaches
will vary. Part of the philosophy concentration and minor; may also be taken as

nature and primacy of sight. It explores how technologies of seeing and imaging have influenced theories of sight and our most dominant and authoritative practices of seeing and representing in the humanities and the arts as well
as in the natural and social sciences. The course will focus on the impact these
theories and practices of seeing and representing—both analog and digital—
have on the nature of knowing as well as on how they shape and mediate our
experiences of personal and social identity and agency more generally. Part of
the philosophy concentration and minor; may also be taken as an elective. (At
least one prior course in philosophy is strongly recommended) Class 4, Credit
4 (offered at least once every two years)

Anthropology
0510-210
Cultural Anthropology
This course explores how human beings across the globe live and work
according to different values and beliefs. Students will develop the tools for
acquiring knowledge, awareness and appreciation of cultural differences and
in turn enhance their abilities to interact across cultures. The course accomplishes these aims by examining the relationship between individuals and
their communities, and the dynamics of ritual, religious, political and social
life in different parts of the world. Fulfills a liberal arts core social/behavioral
science requirement. Counts as a prerequisite for the sociology/anthropology
concentration and minor. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered quarterly)

Anthropologists use techniques of immersion to gain a close, insider’s view
of a culture. Anthropological research addresses some of the most prominent
and pressing social issues of our time, including international migration, mass
media, changing views of gender and sexuality, racism, tourism, religious
fundamentalism, ethnic nationalism, war and genocide, hunger and famine,
and the globalization of popular culture. This course introduces cultural anthropology, and each year it may focus on a different topic. Fulfills a liberal arts
core social/behavioral science requirement. Counts as the prerequisite for the
sociology/anthropology concentration and minor. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered

Cultures in Globalization
Change in all subsystems of human culture is the norm on the planet Earth as
its human inhabitants begin the 21st century and a new millennium. In particular, the stress and strain that accompany change challenge tradition lifeways
among both tribal and peasant societies in the developing world. The change
is driven by many factors, including global and local population growth and
by the expanding world capitalist system through which technology is transferred and the culture of consumption is spread to the most remote corners of
the globe. This course presents an anthropological perspective in which both
historical and cross-cultural approaches to the study of cultural dynamics
are emphasized. Required course for international studies majors. Part of the
sociology/anthropology and Latino/Latina/Latin American concentrations;
sociology/anthropology minor, may be taken as an elective. (0510-210, 0515210 or equivalent) Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

this course introduces the cultures and societies of Latin America and the
Spanish-speaking Caribbean. We review ancient indigenous cultures (Maya,
Inca and Aztec) and ancient adaptations to the land. We examine Spanish and
Portuguese colonialism and its consequences, including ethnic inequalities,
economic vulnerability and social unrest. We look at the diversity of identities and how they are expressed creatively in dress, cuisine and art; religious
diversity (from Santeria to Pentecostal Christianity); life in the countryside
and the city; the changing roles of women and men, and how Latin American
cultures are shaped by globalization but also maintain their distinctiveness.

of different immigrant groups, ranging from East Asian Indians in California
to Arabs in Michigan, Sudanese in Minnesota, Brazilians in New York City,
and Haitians in Florida. We look at the causes and historical patterns of migration and the kinds of jobs that immigrants have filled in the economy, everything from migrant farmworker to software engineer. We read about how
immigrants adapt within the American cultural landscape; connections with
the homeland; current debates in immigration law; and how immigration has
changed since 9/11. Part of the sociology/anthropology concentration and

Sustainable Development
The international economic system (capitalist) has demonstrated extraordinary power in distributing goods to the farthest reaches of the globe. At the
same time there is an increase in inequality and in the numbers of poor and
hungry, often associated with environmental degradation. These changes are
especially obvious in cities but are not limited to them. Since 1987, building
on the work of the Brundtland Commission, there has been a concerted effort
by the United Nations, by nongovernmental organizations, by individuals
and by some nation states to explore paths of more sustainable development.
This course explores varied strategies now employed to achieve sustainable
development, with particular attention to less developed countries. Part of the
sociology concentration and minor; may also be taken as an elective. Part of
the environmental studies minor. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

Social Movements in Global Economy
Demonstrations in Seattle, Genoa, Seoul, Johannesburg, Mumbai, Porto Alegre
and Cochabamba—economic globalization has given birth to global social
movements. This course examines how global economic integration is brought
about through multinational corporations, outsourcing, free-trade agreements,
international lending and neoliberal economic reforms. We consider various
impacts (cultural, economic, political, health and environmental) of these
trends on employees, farmers, small businesses and consumers in the developed and developing worlds. Finally, we look at the beliefs and strategies of
social movements that have mobilized workers, farmers, students, scientists,
environmentalists and others into global coalitions. Part of Latino/Latina/
Latin American concentration; the sociology/anthropology and Spanish language/culture concentrations and minors; may also be taken as an elective.

Native North Americans
The resilience of Native North Americans continues to amaze anthropologists
and those who once proclaimed them certain for extinction. What can now
be acclaimed as a remarkable revival of dead Indians, these cultures are rich
and thriving. They maintain their world views but in a drastically changed
and contemporary setting. Many tribes own casinos, hotels, resorts and other
successful businesses. Not only are the values and their heritage alive and
well, they are quite successful in reviving the formerly outlawed traditions
of the past such as potlatch, medicine lodge and ghost dance. This course is
taught from a Native American perspective and addresses both past and current issues that affect their culture, heritage and tribal sovereignty. Part of the
sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; may also be taken as an
elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)
0510-447
Anthropology of Mass Media
This course examines the cultural importance of mass media in different
societies. By analyzing the flow of media images across national borders,
emphasis is given to the local impact of media culture in different parts of the
world. How, for example, do mass media represent and shape the cultural
values and beliefs in developing societies? What is the role of mass media in
forging national and ethnic identities, body images, sexuality and gender, and
the experience of war and violence in Western and non-Western societies? Part
of the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; may also be taken as
an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)
0510-448
Native North Americans in Film
From visions of romantic fantasy to imagery of the barbaric and horrific,
Native Americans have been misrepresented in film since the invention
of motion pictures. Tonto, Pocahontas, Hiawatha, and how the West was
won—how do you know what is real and what is imagined? This course
examines the genre of Native American films and intends to critically analyze
stereotypes and false imagery and how these have infatuated even the most
educated viewers. While anthropologists studied diligently among Native
Americans, they too fed Hollywood the embellished images that dominate
the big screen. We will identify the roles anthropologists have played in the
emergence and correction of these Native American stereotypes. Part of the
sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; may also be taken as an
elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)

0510-451
Gender and Sexuality
This course explores issues of gender and sexuality in a global context.
Students will be introduced to anthropological perspectives on the experience
of men and women, as gendered subjects, in different societies and historical
contexts, such as colonialism, nationalism, and global capitalism. In turn, we
will explore how cultural constructions of masculinity and femininity are
configured by race, class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Course materials
are drawn from an array of sources, reflecting various theoretical perspectives and ethnographic views from different parts of the world. Part of the
Sociology concentration and minor may be taken as a Liberal Arts elective.

Culture and Expression
The world’s cultural diversity is most vividly and dynamically displayed
through ritual, music, dance and festival. Through examination of performances in different cultures, this course examines performance as an expression of cultural beliefs, values and identity. Films and firsthand observations
complement assigned readings. Topics include the relationship between the
individual artist and culture, the transformative power of ritual, debates
about tradition and authenticity, the politics of cultural performance and
its impacts. Written expression is enhanced through drafting, revision, peer
review and conferences with the instructor, while oral or signed expression
is enhanced through in-class presentations. No prerequisite. May be used for

see themselves. This course examines ways in which we can understand and
represent the reality of others through visual media, across the boundaries
of culture, gender and race. It considers how and why visual media can be
used to represent or to distort the world around us. Part of the anthropology/

Divided Europe
As Europe strives for political and economic unity, we see a concurrent push
toward inequality, exclusion and marginalization: minorities, immigrants, refugees, blacks, Muslims, Jews, gypsies and women struggle against discrimination. Not only the legacy of colonialism but the revitalization of nationalism
shape contemporary European cultural politics. Based on an anthropological
perspective, this course examines ways in which we can understand a divided
Europe through the intersections of race, ethnicity, class, gender and religion.

Anthropology of Religion
Religious expression, from the spiritualism of vodoun to the monotheism
of Judaism and Islam, is the subject of this course. The course explores four
religious dimensions—sacred speech, sacred acts, sacred beings and sacred
places—through broad cross-cultural samples, including, among others,
contemporary Haiti; the Cibecue Apache and Hopi of native North America;
Pygmy, San and Azande of Africa; Bali in Indonesia; and Jewish and Islamic
fundamentalism in southwest Asia. Religious practice is explored in holistic
cultural content. Insights into religious practice are developed from the point
of view of the practitioners and the outside observer. Part of the sociology/

Islamic Culture and the Middle East
This course introduces the fundamentals of the Middle East, with an emphasis
on Islam, to students with little or no background in the region or the culture.
The four themes to be addressed include: foundations of Islam; Islamic law
and Islamic sects; material and performance culture in Islam; and Islamic culture and the West. The rationale for this course is to help students recognize

Archaeology and the Human Past
Archaeology is the study of the human past, from the origin of our species
through the development of modern, industrial states. In studying the past,
archaeology seeks to explain how we, as modern humans came to be. This
course discusses how archaeologists study the past and explain how human
society has changed over time, and presents an overview of world prehistory.
Specific topics will include the evolution of modern humans, the peopling of
the world, the development of agriculture, the rise of states and the development of urban society. Case studies will be used throughout to demonstrate
how archaeological research is conducted and how archaeologists use their
research to formulate explanations of the past that have relevance for the present. Part of the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor. May also be
taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)
0510-506
Great Discoveries in Archaeology
Archaeology conjures a romantic image in the minds of many people, and
almost everyone is familiar with at least some of the greatest discoveries made
by archaeologists. Finds such as King Tut’s tomb, the ancient city of Troy, the
jungle cities of the Maya, and Otzi the Ice Man excite almost anyone who
hears of them. But what is it, aside from fabulous wealth, romantic locale or
incredible preservation that makes them great? Although great discoveries
are always exciting, archaeology is not only about finding things but also
about using these findings to explain the human past. This course helps us
understand how and why human society has changed over time. It explores
some of the great discoveries of archaeology, many of which will be familiar
to students. Part of the sociology/anthropology concentration; may be taken
as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

recording, photography and artifact conservation will also be discussed.
Students will be able to analyze the usefulness of the field techniques in light
of the archaeological scientific methods for dating, and organic and inorganic
analyses. Students should emerge from the course understanding the values
of the techniques necessary for proper archaeological excavation towards the
reconstruction of the past and the development of an understanding of our
present. Part of the archaeology concentration. May be taken as an elective.

Native North Americans
The resilience of Native North Americans continues to amaze anthropologists
and those who once proclaimed them certain for extinction. In what can now be
acclaimed as a remarkable revival of dead Indians, these cultures are rich and
thriving. They maintain their world views but in a drastically changed and contemporary setting. Many tribes own casinos, hotels, resorts and other successful
businesses. Not only are the values and their heritage alive and well, they are
quite successful in reviving the formerly outlawed traditions of the past such
as the potlatch, medicine lodge and ghost dance. This course is taught from a
Native American perspective and addresses both past and current issues that
affect the culture, heritage and tribal sovereignty. Part of the material culture science concentration; may be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4

Native Americans in Film
From visions of romantic fantasy to imagery of the barbaric and horrific,
Native Americans have been misrepresented in film since the invention of
motion pictures. Tonto, Pocahontas, Hiawatha, and how the West was won—
how do you know what is real and what is imagined? This course examines
the genre of Native American films and intends to critically analyze stereotypes, false imagery and how these have infatuated even the most educated of
viewers. While anthropologists studied diligently among Native Americans,
they too fed Hollywood the embellished images that dominate the big screen.
We will identify the roles anthropologists have played in the emergence and
correction of these Native American stereotypes. Part of material culture science concentration; may be taken as an elective. Cross-listed with 0510-448.

Great Discoveries in Archaeology
Archaeology conjures a romantic image in the minds of many people and
almost everyone is at least familiar with some of the greatest discoveries made
by archaeologists. Finds such as King Tut’s tomb, the ancient city of Troy,
the jungle cities of the Maya and Otzi the Ice Man excite almost anyone who
hears of them. But what is it, aside from fabulous wealth, romantic locale or
incredible preservation that makes them great? Although great discoveries are
always exciting, archaeology is not only about finding things but also about
using these findings to explain the human past. This course helps us understand how and why human society has changed over time. It explores some
of the great discoveries of archaeology, many of which will be familiar to
students. Part of the archaeology concentration; may be taken as an elective.

to the fact that archaeology relies primarily on physical evidence. This course
examines the growing field of archaeological science. It covers a number
of archaeological questions, including the age and origin of materials; how
things are made; what people ate; their daily activities; their state of health;
and how archaeological scientists are able to answer these questions using
techniques from biology, chemistry and physics. The course includes in-class
labs in which students apply some of these techniques and a final research
project in which they pick their own archaeological question and methodology to answer it. Part of the material culture science and archaeology concentrations; may be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

bulk polymer structure, behavior and properties. The course follows a synthetic path; the structure property relationships for polymeric materials are
built up from a microscopic to a macroscopic level. One of the most important
lessons of the course is that polymers are almost never in a thermodynamically stable state. Consequently, the behavior of polymers and the properties
they display are time dependent and vary with the thermo-mechanical history
of the materials. (1029-501, 502) Class 4, Credit 4 (F-X*)

Polymer Characterization Laboratory
This course introduces, and gives the student experience with, analytical techniques commonly employed to characterize high polymers. To accomplish
this, the course is divided into five sections, each highlighting a particular
characteristic of polymeric materials: molecular weight distributions; spectroscopic analysis of chemical structure; thermal stability; morphology and
phase transitions, and mechanical properties. The experiments, each requiring
eight lab hours to complete, are designed to give students exposure to laboratory techniques not generally covered in undergraduate science/engineering
curriculum. Although the documentation of experimental results is important,
and will be evaluated, the main purpose is to give the student hands-on
experience, hopefully piquing his/her interest in and enthusiasm for the field.
