order, for students first need to learn when, where and by whom (whether a
people, or a known individual) a given object was produced before they can
attempt to determine why the object was made, what it meant in its time and
place (as opposed to what it may mean to us today), and whose ideology it
served. Once we know how to classify visual information, we may be able to
make historical sense of the surviving evidence. Credit 3

to artists of the last three decades. We will examine texts that propose art to
be a form of activism and persuade artists to be responsible for the way they
represent the world and maybe even determine if the goal of art is not to represent it in the first place. The artists we discuss are concerned with problems
in our society that affect gender, race, sexuality, poverty, labor issues, and the
environment. (2039-225, 226, 227) Credit 3

Modern Poetry
From Walt Whitman’s “barbaric yawp,” to Emily Dickinson’s “letter to the
world that never wrote to me,” and Baudelaire’s “breath of wind from the
wings of madness,” Modern Poetry is a body of literature characterized by
bold changes in voice, form, and subject matter. This course offers a close

Autobiography
0504-490 	
According to poet James Merrill, we live in the age of “me-moir”, at least in
American culture. But what happens to the quarrel between truth and fiction, to the forms of language and self-representation, as we move outside
of England and America? In this course, we will explore the history and
assumptions of traditional autobiographical writing, particularly in the past
two centuries. We will examine a rich spectrum of life-writings, ranging from
formal autobiography to “outlaw narratives, including selections from diaries, journals and visual self-portraits in art, photography and film. In these
works, we will trace new modes of constructing identity as we redefine the
boundaries of family, nation, class and gender. Part of the literary and cultural

Native American Women’s Experience
0504-492	
This course examines the unique status of Native American women in tribal
and Euroamerican societies. Given the gender complementary construction of
many tribal communities, Native women long enjoyed a status and power not
found in Europe, but this equality has been altered in many tribes as a result
of colonialism. We will study how Native women have responded to assaults
on the “feminine principle,” as Paula Gunn Allen terms it. We will examine
the following themes in Native women’s lives: tribal gender roles, nation,
community, family, class, work, race, sexuality, disability, culture-bearing,
environment, land, health, and representation. Part of the literary and cultural
studies concentration and minor. May also be taken as an elective. Cross listed

Maps, Spaces, and Places
“Space Speaks!” Diverse writers, critics and filmmakers represented in this
course are rethinking space as a dynamic context for the making of history
and for different organizations of social and communal life. We begin with a
meditation on the language of maps and mapmaking, both antique and digital, exploring the idea that to present a useful and truthful picture, an accurate
map must tell lies. Among our initial questions, consider these: how do certain interests come to be embodied in mapmaking? How do films and literary
texts-poems, novels, memoirs-imaginatively construct space? In what ways,
particularly in texts do mapmaking and power mutually reinforce various
kinds of social authority, yet deny others? Focusing such questions, the course
offers an opportunity for a solo or collaborative project on digital mapping, or
“Reading RIT and Rochester as Text.” No prerequisite. Part of the literature
concentration and minor. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

Pan-Indian Native American Literature
This course examines Native American literature from the end of the Indian
Wars, as demarcated by the massacre at Wounded Knee, through the relocation
and termination eras to just before the Native American Renaissance. During
these years, we witness the emergence of a pan-Indian identity that results in
part from colonial policies, such as boarding schools, and results in intertribal
political coalitions, such as the Society for American Indians. This course
focuses upon the literatures generated from this shift in Native consciousness
and asks students to consider issues of identity formation. Part of the literary
and cultural studies concentration and minor. May also be taken as an elective.

Contemporary Native American Literature
0504-495	
The year 1968 marks the beginning of an era referred to by Kenneth Lincoln as
the “Native American Renaissance.” Beginning with the publication of Scott
Momaday’s House Made Of Dawn, we begin to see the emergence of a substantial body of texts commonly recognized by dominant standards as a “literature.” This course seeks to contextualize these late 20th century works in their
individual tribal and larger pan-Indian traditions noting the earlier literary
traditions that inform them. We will consider texts commonly conceived of
as “metropolitan,” as well as those that firmly reject mainstream expectations
of literature. Part of the literary and cultural studies concentration and minor.

of motion pictures. Tonto, Pocahontas, Hiawatha, and how the west was
won-how do you know what is real and what is imagined? This course
examines the genre of Native American films and intends to critically analyze
stereotypes, false imagery, and how these have infatuated even the most
educated of viewers. While anthropologists studied diligently among Native
Americans, they too fed Hollywood the embellished images that dominate
the big screen. We will identify the roles anthropologists have played in the
emergence and correction of these Native American stereotypes. Part of the

Introduction to Archaeology
0510-502	
Archaeology is the study of the human past, from the origin of our species
through the development of modern, industrial states. In studying the past,
archeology seeks to explain how we, as modern humans came to be. This
course discusses how archeologists study the past and explain how human
society has changed over time, and present an overview of world prehistory,
examining key developments in the human past. Specific topics will include
the evolution of modern humans, the peopling of the world, the development
of agriculture, the rise of states and the development of urban society. Case
studies will be used throughout to demonstrate how archaeological research
is conducted and how archaeologists use their research to formulate explanations of the past that have relevance for the present. Part of the sociology/
anthropology concentration and minor. May also be taken as an elective. Class
4, Credit 4

Great Discoveries in Archaeology
Archaeology conjures a romantic image in the minds of many people and
almost everyone is at least familiar with some of the greatest discoveries made
by archeologists. Finds such as King Tut’s tomb, the ancient city of Troy, the
jungle cities of the Maya, and Otzi the Ice Man, excite almost anyone who
hears of them. But what is it, aside from fabulous wealth, romantic locale,
or incredible preservation that makes them great? Although great discoveries are always exciting, archeology is not only about finding things, but also
about using these findings to explain the human past. This course helps us
understand how and why human society has changed over time. It explores
some of the great discoveries of archeology, many of which will be familiar to
students. Part of the sociology/anthropology concentration and may also be
taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)
0510-507	
Archaeological Science
Archaeology is one of the few social sciences that lends itself well to the application of analytical techniques from the physical sciences. This is largely due
to the fact that archaeology relies primarily on physical evidence. Physical
science techniques can yield powerful insights into daily life in past societies.
This course examines the growing field of archaeological science. The course
covers a number of archaeological questions including the age and origin of
materials; how things are made; what people ate; their daily activities; their
state of health; and how archaeological scientists are able to answer these
questions using techniques from biology, chemistry, and physics. The course
includes in-class labs in which students apply some of these techniques and
a final research project in which the student picks their own archaeological
question and methodology to answer it. Part of the sociology/anthropology
concentration and minor. May also be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4

Benefit-Cost Analysis
0511-450	
Explores the use and abuse of benefit-cost and related analytical techniques
commonly encountered in economic policy making. Many expenditure and
regulatory programs of governmental agencies now are routinely evaluated
in a benefit-cost or cost-effectiveness framework, and debate about policy
decisions increasingly draws upon benefit-cost findings. Yet, application of
benefit-cost analysis often attracts much controversy, in part because of disagreements about how to conduct such analysis and about the role that economic efficiency should play in societal decisions. The mechanics, power and
limitations of this form of analysis form the primary elements of the course.

Senior Project in Psychology
This course is intended for students in the psychology major to demonstrate
independent, experimental research expertise. Students are guided by faculty
advisors in conducting experimental research on an issue of their choice.
Students design the method, run subjects, and analyze the results of their
study. Students write up the project in APA format. Passing this write-up
qualifies the students for the writing requirement in psychology. Because
Senior Project is the culmination of a student’s scientific research learning
experience in the psychology major, it is expected that the project will be
somewhat novel, will extend the theoretical understanding of their previous
work (or of the previous work of another researcher), and go well beyond any
similar projects that they might have done in any of their previous courses.

each requiring eight lab hours to complete, are designed to give students
exposure to laboratory techniques not generally covered in undergraduate
science/engineering curriculum. Although the documentation of experimental results is important, and will be evaluated, the main purpose is to give
the student hands-on experience, hopefully piquing his/her interest in and
