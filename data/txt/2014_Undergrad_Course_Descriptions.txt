involving the description and analysis of physiological mechanisms from a systems point of
view. The first course in this sequence will be concerned with fundamental aspects of electrophysiology, electrically excitable cells and tissue, the operation of the nervous system including
the central, peripheral, somatic and autonomic systems, the special senses and the connection
between the nervous system and the endocrine system. Differences and relationships between
speed, specificity and sensitivity of signaling mechanism of the nervous system and the endocrine system will be discussed. The cardiovascular system is introduced in terms of its control
and impact on overall regulation of homeostasis. (BIME-370, PHYS-211, CHME-320, BIOG141) Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

Systems Physiology II
The second in a two course sequence involving the description and analysis of physiological
mechanisms from a systems point of view. The focus of this course will be on the interaction
between organ systems for the purpose of homeostasis. In particular, attention will be paid to
feedback mechanisms that involve electrical and chemical feedback and control systems. Fluid
and gas transport mechanisms associated with the cardiovascular and respiratory systems
including their regulatory behavior and the function of the kidney are introduced by way of
their contribution to fluid volume and pressures as well as its fundamental material exchange
properties. Engineering analysis methods will be applied to an open-ended problem associated
with pathological performance of some aspect of these systems and will be used to proposing
a suitable compensatory mechanism to address or eliminate it. The interaction between the
nervous, muscular, digestive, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, renal and respiratory systems and how they affect growth and metabolism, movement, fluid and electrolyte balance,
material exchange and disease processes will be discussed. Open-ended problems and weaknesses in these mechanisms will be discussed and addressed in a quantitative and analytical

Numerical and Statistical Analysis of Complex Biosystems
This is the second course in a two sequence course in engineering analytical and problem

strategies and tools that engineers use to predict the cause-and-effect behavior of complex
systems. Students will develop the tools to analyze the dynamic behavior of biomedical situations that are more complex, and thus require a greater degree of analytical sophistication, than
the systems examined in Engineering Analysis I. The analysis of such problems will require
the use of differential equations and numerical analysis, as well as the application of software
packages (e.g., spreadsheets, graphing, Matlab). The set of tools that are developed and whose
application is demonstrated also serve to provide a solid framework for quantitative and critical evaluation of material to be presented in upper level engineering courses. While some of
the problems analyzed will be well described by a deterministic perspective, a significant element of the course will be the analysis of situations that are fundamentally stochastic and thus
require a probabilistic, statistical approach to their modeling and solution. (BIME-250, MATH231, CQAS-251; co-requisite: CQAS-252) Class 3, Credit 3 (F)

Survey of Western Art and Architecture I
The subject of this year-long course is the history of western art and architecture from prehistory through the early 20th century. We will examine the form, style, function, and meaning
of important objects and monuments of the past, and consider these in their social, historical
and cultural contexts. A chronological study will allow us to recognize when, where and by
whom a given object was produced. Once these decisive factors are established, we may try to
determine why the object was made, what it meant in its time, place and culture, and whose
ideology it served. Since we are dealing with visual information, the primary goals of this class
are to learn how to look, and how to describe and analyze what we see. At the end of the year,
students will be prepared to pursue more advanced courses in the discipline, for they will
have gained a foundational knowledge of the object, scope and methods of art history. The
knowledge obtained in this introductory course will also guide students in their own creative
endeavors. Class 3, Credit 3 (F, S)

Art and Activism
This course will focus on artists using their work for the purpose of changing society. Students
will consider work by both individual artists and artists working in groups that cause critics,
art historians, other artists and the viewing public to ask if what they are doing is art. Although
there will be forays back to the 19th and early 20th centuries, most time will be dedicated to
artists of the last three decades. We will examine texts that propose art to be a form of activism
and persuade artists to be responsible for the way they represent the world—and maybe even
determine if the goal of art is not to represent it in the first place. What is Art? What should
Art be? What should Art do? But is it Art? are just some of the questions that are asked when
art comes into contact with the political—especially when that art proposes to make a political or social change—i.e., when art becomes action. Although these questions may not seem
immediately answerable, it is our responsibility to ask them and then attempt to answer them
as best we can. The artists and theorists that we will discuss are concerned with problems in
our society that effect gender, race, sexuality, poverty, labor issues, and the environment. Most
of these theorists and artists can be classified as angry and confrontational or at least evoking a form of contestation and, therefore, their art and ideas are reflective of these positions.

Art of the Americas
This is a survey course of Native North and South American visual arts within an historical
and anthropological framework. Included will be an examination of the development of principal styles of Ancient American architecture, sculpture, painting, and ceramics up to the 16th
century when the Spanish conquistadors defeated the Aztec and Inca empires and imposed
colonial rule. Consideration is also given to materials used, techniques of construction, individual and tribal styles, as well as to the meaning and function of various art forms within
Native American societies. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)
ARTH-573 
Conceptual Art
This course examines the widely influential mid-1960s art movement that questioned the fundamental nature of art itself by renunciating the material art object as well as the phenomenon
of art making. The definition of art as well as its institutional framework was thereby expanded,
and the idea, concept, or intellectual dimension of the work was underscored. Students will be
acquainted with the philosophical foundations and critical implications of this global movement across a wide spectrum of works and practices (paintings, performance, installations,
books and texts, photography, film, and video) and its relevance to contemporary concerns.

Dada and Surrealism
This course examines the widely influential Dada and Surrealist movements in Europe and
the United States from 1916 through the post-World War II period as well as their relevance
to contemporary concerns. Emphasis is on identifying the major works of artists involved in
these movements as well as their philosophical foundations, critical implications, as well as
broader literary and ideological contexts (e.g. Freud, Breton, Lautr?amont, Leiris and Bataille).
A wide range of works and practices (paintings, performance, installations, literary texts, photography, film, and ephemeral objects) will be studied, and the work of certain key artists
(Höch, Heartfield, Schwitters, Duchamp, Picabia, Dalí, Ernst, Giacometti, Man Ray, Bellmer,
Cahun, Cornell, Magritte, Miro, Oppenheim, Toyen and Picasso) will be analyzed in depth.

ARTH-576 
Modernism and Its Other: Realism in the Shadow of Expressionism
This course is an inquiry into one of the major debates of modern art. This debate had a
seemingly clear victor. The idea that the artist expresses his or her individuality and then
communicates that self to the rest of humanity through a higher, transcendental, language has
dominated the discourse and practice of modernist art. In retrospect, the art that dominated
most of the first half of the 20th century was of an Expressive nature. On the other hand art that
addressed the social and in anyway addressed direct and specific social issues was banished by
art’s major institutions. Realism was dead. In this course we will look at the circumstances of
how Realism became subordinated to Expressionism. We will also address the question of what
exactly constituted the practice of realist art. We will look at the roots of both movements that
will take us at times into 18th and 19th centuries. But mostly we will concentrate on how institutions like the Museum of Modern Art helped define how we see the history of 20th century
art as being determined. We will also explore how Modernism’s other, Realism, survived and
gained new currency in practices of late 20th and early 21st century art. (ARTH-135 Survey of

Displaying Gender
This course brings together two of the most significant strains of recent art historical scholarship: the study of gender in representation and the critical examination of exhibitions and
museums with particular focus given to key examples of curatorial practice from the late 19th
century to the present day. Through readings, possible museum visit(s), class discussions, and
guided individual research, questions of gender in exhibitions will be considered in relation to
other aspects of identity including sexuality, race, and class. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

Edvard Munch
The Norwegian artist Edvard Munch (1863-1944) continues to generate a great deal of popular
interest, critical scholarship, and reflection. The 4-volume catalogue raisonn of his paintings
was published in 2009, and the graphic work appeared in 2001. A painter, printmaker, photographer, and filmmaker, Munch was also a prolific writer, well acquainted with the symbolist
poets and playwrights, as well as the broad intellectual drift of the fin-de-Sicle. He is the one
Scandinavian artist included within the Modernist canon and his image, The Scream (1893), is
an icon of the modern age. Munch traveled widely throughout Europe and his work was exhibited in North America beginning with the famous 1913 Armory Show. This course will examine
recent scholarship devoted to Munch and the critical issues that his work addresses. It will also
place him within the broader cultural context of Scandinavian and European modernism, while
examining his impact on subsequent generations. (ARTH-135 Survey of Western Art History

ARTH-581 
Realism and the Avant-garde in Russian Art
The term avant-garde was originally used to describe the foremost part of an army advancing into battle. The concept of the avant-garde is considered by some to be synonymous with
Modernism. The radical move away from classical forms of representation in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries is typical of how one understands the avant-garde. In Russia, the experiments in art from the mid 1890s through 1922 are seen as modernist avant-garde practices that
were extreme departures from art practices of the earlier 19th century. And although this art
is very often described, like other western art of the period, in terms of form rather than with
regard to its ideological content. We will examine the avant-garde’s social and, therefore, political underpinnings. In order to get to the roots of an earlier understanding of the avant-garde,
we find in its beginnings the writings of Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon, and
Olinde Rodrigues. In Russia the artists who painted images that represented the social world,
and therefore put themselves in opposition to the status quo, were known as the Peredvizhniki.
We will try to amend this misunderstanding and connect this group of artists to the Russian
formal and political avant-garde of the early 20th century and to the latter non-conformist
artists of the second half of the 20th century that coincides with Perestroika and the eventual
demise of the Soviet Union. (ARTH-135 Survey of Western Art History I and ARTH-136 Survey

Medieval Craft
In this course, we will explore the history of craft production throughout the Middle Ages. While
modern scholars have often divided art from craft, this distinction did not exist in medieval
Europe: artists were craftspeople, producing objects that were both practically and symbolically
functional. This class will focus on the decorative arts including stained glass, ivories, textiles,
and metalwork to produce a more integrated picture of medieval visual culture. Students will
study both practical aspects of production and the reception and meaning of these objects
within medieval society. Class 3, Credit 3 (F, S)
ARTH-583 
Installation Art
This course will introduce students to historic, contemporary, and critical issues surrounding
installation art. There will be an introduction to the development of installation art as a genre.
We will examine the changes, which have developed over the past three decades, of object
sculpture to non-object. There will be an emphasis on the development of the concept of an
installation project and its relationship to site and/or audience. Both public and gallery spaces
will be discussed. (ARTH-136 Survey of Western Art and Architecture II and ARTH-368 20th

Scandinavian Modernism
This course examines the decorative arts and visual culture of modern Scandinavia from 1860
to the present, with special emphasis on the social, economic, and political impulses that have
shaped them. Scandinavian Modern design plays a significant role in the postwar epoch; it is
equated with such leading brands as Volvo, Saab, Ericsson, Nokia, H&M, Electrolux Orrefors,
Georg Jensen, ARTEK, Iitala, and IKEA and the idea of progressive, social democracy. The
myths and realities of its success will be examined and related to emerging cultural and national
identities, as well as its impact on contemporary design. (ARTH-135 Survey of Western Art

Anthropology
ANTH-102 
Cultural Anthropology
This course explores how human beings across the globe live and work according to different
values and beliefs. Students will develop the tools for acquiring knowledge, awareness, and
appreciation of cultural differences, and in turn enhance their abilities to interact across cultures. The course accomplishes these aims by examining the relationship between individuals
and their communities, and the dynamics of ritual, religious, political, and social life in different parts of the world. Class 3, Credit 3 (F, S)
ANTH-102H 
Honors Cultural Anthropology
Anthropology is the holistic science of the human condition, and professional anthropologists
engage in experiential, empirical and humanistic research. Cultural diversity and change are
explored through the anthropological techniques of immersion (ethnographic fieldwork) and
cross-cultural analysis. In-depth and comparative analysis of critical issues may include transnational migration, ethnic nationalism, racism, changing and clashing views on gender and
sexuality, indigenous peoples’ rights, religious fundamentalism, genocide, war, hunger, famine
and cultural and economic dimensions of globalization. The specific topic varies from year to
year. Counts toward the Honors Program requirements and the sociology and anthropology
major, minor, and toward multiple immersions sponsored by the sociology and anthropology department. (Honors Program status or permission of instructor) Class 3, Credit 3 (F)

ANTH-103 
Archaeology and the Human Past
Archaeology is the study of the human past, from the origin of our species through to the development of modern, industrial states by means of the physical remains of past human behavior.
In studying the past, archaeology seeks to explain how we, as modern humans, came to be.
This course investigates how archaeologists study the past, explains how human society has
changed over time, and presents an overview of world prehistory. Specific topics include the
evolution of modern humans, the peopling of the world, the development of agriculture, the
rise of state-level societies and associated social technologies such as writing and urbanism.
Case studies will be used throughout to demonstrate how archaeological research is conducted and how archaeologists use their research to formulate explanations of the past that have
relevance for the present. Class 3, Credit 3 (F, S)
ANTH-201 
Writing About Society and Culture
This course explores the politics and poetics of writing about society and culture. Writing is a
form of power, in that our representations of people influence the way that others think about
and act toward them. The way that social researchers write is therefore shot through with ethical implications and weighty decisions. Critical issues include whether people are objectified,
cast as wholly other, culture-bound or creative, out of the past or coeval, racialized or of a common humanity, problematic or multifaceted, passive or agentive, mystified or perceptive, and
mechanical or extraordinary. Writing about society and culture is also poetic. We can convey
something of people’s life experiences, thoughts, agency, and the constraints within which they
lead their lives. How well we do so depends upon our ethical reflexivity and attention to the
poetics of language. In this course, we will consider these ethical questions, read experimental
texts, and discuss how writing style implicitly conveys social theory. Required for sociology
and anthropology major; counts toward sociology and anthropology minor. Cross-listed with
SOCI-201. (Any one of the following: ANTH-102, ANTH-102H, ANTH-103, INGS-101, SOCI102, SOCI-102H, SOCI-103, or equivalent). Class 3, Credit 3 (F)
ANTH-210 
Culture and Globalization
This course explores critical issues of globalizing culture. How are ideas, attitudes, and values
exchanged or transmitted across conventional borders? How has the production, articulation, and dissemination of cultural forms (images, languages, practices, beliefs) been shaped
by global capitalism, media industries, communication technologies, migration, and tourist
travels? How are cultural imaginaries forged, exchanged, and circulated among a global consumer public? How has the internationalizing of news, computer technologies, video-sharing
websites, blogging sites, and other permutations of instant messaging served to accelerate
cultural globalization? Students will be introduced to anthropological perspectives on cultural
globalization, the transmission of culture globally, and the subsequent effects on social worlds,
peoples, communities, and nations. (Second year status). Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
ANTH-215 
Field Methods in Archaeology
This course introduces students to the methods of archaeological fieldwork. The course begins
with the student’s development of a research question and design. We then explore the feasibility of this research through the examination of sampling techniques, site survey, and excavation.
Field methods of recording, photography and artifact conservation will also be discussed.
Students will be able to analyze the usefulness of the field techniques in light of the archaeological scientific methods for dating, and organic and inorganic analyses. Students should emerge
from the course understanding the values of the techniques necessary for proper archaeological
excavation toward the reconstruction of the past and the development of an understanding of
our present. Counts toward the sociology and anthropology program; sociology and anthropology minor; archaeological science minor; archaeology immersion Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
ANTH-220 
Language and Culture
This introductory course in linguistic anthropology surveys the great variety of ways humans
communicate both verbally and non-verbally with an emphasis on cross-cultural communication. The course explores the complex interplay between language and culture. Language is
a core element of culture, both as a repository of meaning, and also because it is the primary
means through which humans carry out social relationships, share ideas, and contest received
understandings. Topics will vary by semester, and may include: metaphor and narrative; language acquisition in relationship to childhood socialization; language, thought and worldview;
language and identity; multilingualism; the social contexts of language change; literacy; and the
politics of language use and language ideologies. Class 3, Credit 3 (F, bi-annual)

ANTH-225 
Globalizing Africa
This course introduces students to processes of interconnection, local, regional, national and
global, that have altered and continue to impact life in Africa, taking into account the enormous impact of Africans on one another and on those of us living outside of the continent. In
the course, we will focus on how past, present and anticipated future events in African movements of people, ideas and things, across time and space effect the reception of new events. We
will pay particularly close attention to how the relationships of time and space are formulated
and understood by Africans in the present. While the historical past is never completed, but
continuous in the present, its diverse contours lead to differently remembered, embodied, and
enacted expressions. We will evaluate these diverse expressions in pre-colonial, colonial and
neo-colonial encounters as they have changed ideas of self and other, political philosophies and
political economic systems, genders and sexualities, generational relations, religions, expressive
arts, violence, and health on the African continent and around the globe. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)
ANTH-230 
Great Discoveries in Archaeology
Archaeology conjures a romantic image in the minds of many people and almost everyone is
at least familiar with some of the greatest discoveries made by archaeologists. Finds such as
King Tut’s tomb, the ancient city of Troy, the jungle cities of the Maya, and Otzi the Ice Man
excite almost anyone who hears of them. But what is it, aside from fabulous wealth, romantic
locale, or incredible preservation that makes them great? Although great discoveries are always
exciting, archaeology is not only about finding things, but also about using these findings to
explain the human past. This course explores some of the great discoveries of archaeology,
many of which will be familiar to the student, to demonstrate how archaeologists construct
an explanation of human prehistory and cultural change. (ANTH-103 Archaeology and the
Human Past) Class 3, Credit 3 (F/S, alternating years)
ANTH-235 
Immigration to the U.S.
This course examines immigration to the U.S. within the context of globalization. We examine
the push- and pull-factors that generate immigration, and changing immigration policies and
debates. We consider how changes in the American workplace have stimulated the demand for
foreign workers in a wide range of occupations, from software engineer to migrant farmworker
and nanny. We review the cultural and emotional challenges of adapting within the American
cultural landscape; transnationalism and connections with the homeland; the experiences of
refugees; and how immigration has changed since 9/11. Special attention is given to immigration from Latin America, the largest sending region. Counts toward the international and
global studies program (globalization concentration elective; Latin America track); sociology
and anthropology program (cultural anth track); sociology and anthropology minor; cultural
anthropology immersion; globalization theory immersion. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)

Muslim Youth Cultures
In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in youths and Muslim youths, in particular, as a result of increased media attention to security, religious extremism, and human
rights. These concerns, while important, obscure other equally vital aspects of being young and
Muslim in rapidly globalizing societies. Taken in isolation of other informational sources, media
representations of Muslim youths contribute to severe forms of misinformation and to negative stereotypes, sources of social anxiety and potential conflict. Students, taking this course,
by contrast, will develop critical, anthropological approaches to youths and Muslim youth cultures, taking up Muslim youths’ concerns with important aspects of their lives, generation and
authority; global capitalism and class distinctions; religious identifications; spaces of memory
and the control of public space; global education; new technologies and their affects on sociality, gender and sexuality; war and occupation; and expressive arts. Through in-depth studies
of Muslim youth cultures in the Middle East and Africa, the course offers broad perspectives
on the diversity and complexity of Muslim youth cultures and their affects on changing societies, cultures, nations and the world. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
ANTH-245 
Ritual and Performance
The world’s cultural diversity is most vividly and dynamically displayed through ritual and festival. Ritual is anything but superfluous; rather, some of the most important work of culture is
accomplished through the performance of ritual. Through cross-cultural comparison, by way
of readings and films, we explore the following dimensions of ritual: symbols, embodiment,
emotion, discipline, contestation of tradition and authenticity, and the orchestration of birth,
childhood socialization, gender, maturation, marriage, community, hierarchy, world renewal,
and death. Written expression is enhanced through drafting, revision, and peer review. Counts
toward the sociology and anthropology program (cultural anthropology track); sociology and
anthropology minor; cultural anthropology immersion; religious studies immersion. Class 3,

ANTH-250 
Themes in Archaeological Research
One of the most fascinating dimensions of archaeology is the discovery that people have done
essentially the same things in different places and different times, independently of developments elsewhere. Agriculture, writing, urbanism, complex economies, and so on, all have been
independently invented multiple times in different parts of the world. This fact raises some
intriguing questions about what it means to be human. By comparing how these developments
occurred in different places and times, archaeologists can, in a sense, perform experiments on
the past. Each semester this course is offered we will focus on a separate theme in archaeological research, such as the transition to agriculture; production, trade, and exchange; the origin of
writing; imperialism, colonialism, and warfare; pseudoscience/pseudoarchaeology; or human
evolution. We will study competing theoretical perspectives and different world regions to gain
a broad understanding of the theme and how both theory and data are used to create a comprehensive understanding of the human past. (ANTH-103 Archaeology and the Human Past)
Class 3, Credit 3 (F, S alternating years)
ANTH-255 
Regional Archaeology
Since the first humans set out from Africa nearly two million years ago, our ancestors and relatives managed to settle in almost every continent. Wherever they went, they left traces of their
lives that are tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years deep. We call these traces
the archaeological record. Almost everywhere our ancestors settled, they did many of the same
things, such as inventing agriculture, cities, writing, and state-level societies. However, they
did this in ways unique to each region and time. This course examines the archaeology of a
specific region, such as Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica, North Africa, or East Asia, in detail. We
examine the geography, culture, archaeological record, and significance of the region to various key themes in archaeological research. (ANTH-103 Archaeology and the Human Past)
Class 3, Credit 3 (F/S, alternating years)
ANTH-260 
Native North Americans
This course will examine persistence and change in Native American cultures using archaeological, ethnohistorical, ethnographic, linguistic and autobiographical sources among others.
In addition to broad regional and historical coverage, we will read about and discuss culture
change, colonialism, federal law, gender, race and places in Native American contexts. Our
goal is to understand the lived experiences of Indian people and the many forces that shape
Native American lives. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
ANTH-265 
Native Americans in Film
This course will examine the parallels of anthropological works and resulting Government
policies in the late-19th and 20th centuries as they relate to the genre of Native Americans
film, both popular and ethnographic works. In addition, an extensive regional and historical
literature review will complement the possible films. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)
ANTH-270 
Cuisine, Culture and Power
Physically, culturally, and socially, humans live through food and drink. Spanning the globe, as
nearly limitless omnivores, humans have developed myriad ways of collecting and cultivating
food and taking advantage of local environments. We also put food to work for us socially by
creating cuisine. Through cuisine, we forge and nourish relationships, commune with deities,
and through luxury choices, demonstrate our “taste” and lay claim to elite status. Through the
cultural practices of production and consumption of food and drink, we wield power. Food and
drink consumption patterns have sustained slavery, poverty, malnutrition, and illegal immigration, and have laid waste to the environment. In this class, we explore physical, cultural,
social, political, and economic dimensions of food and become more aware of how the private,
intimate act of a bite connects us to the rest of humanity. Counts toward the international and
global studies major (sustainable futures track); sociology and anthropology major (cultural
anthropology track); sociology and anthropology minor; cultural anthropology immersion.

ANTH-275 
Global Islam
This course examines the spread of Islam beyond its origins in the Middle East, and the cultural
and social clashes, but also the mutual adjustments that have followed. This course explores
core tenets of Islam, but also how its practices and beliefs are altered as practitioners in different countries alternately adopt, co-opt, massage, react to, and reject elements in accordance
with the meaningful social, cultural, and political lives they build for themselves. The compatibility of Islam with Western society is often debated in contemporary public discourse. This
debate is typically marked by an assumption that Islamic beliefs clash with Western secular
democratic ideals, an assumption which results in tensions over mosque building, headscarves,
and other public signs of Islamic faith. We will explore the diverse ways of being Muslim from
a cross-cultural perspective and the sometimes-challenging negotiation of fulfilling these religious tenets while living in Muslim-minority places. Counts toward the international and
global studies major (Africa, Asia, Europe, and Middle East tracks), sociology and anthropology
major (cultural anthropology track), sociology and anthropology minor, cultural anthropology
immersion. Class 3, Credit 3 (F, biannually)

Sustainable Development
The international economic system (capitalist) has demonstrated extraordinary power in distributing goods to the farthest reaches of the globe. At the same time there is an increase in
inequality and in the numbers of poor and hungry, often associated with environmental degradation. These changes are especially obvious in cities, but not limited to them. Since 1987,
building on the work of the Brundtland Commission, there has been a concerted effort by the
United Nations, by non-governmental organizations, by individuals, and by some nationstates to explore paths of more sustainable development. This course explores varied strategies
now employed to achieve sustainable development, with particular attention to less developed
countries. Counts toward the sociology and anthropology major (cultural anthropology track),
international and global studies major (sustainable futures track), sociology and anthropology
minor, cultural anthropology immersion. Class 3, Credit 3 (F, bi-annual)

ANTH-315 
The Archaeology of Cities
The long course of the human existence has been marked by a series of revolutions that have
profoundly changed society and that ultimately produced the world we live in today. One of
the key revolutions that made our world possible was the invention of urbanism. Cities first
appeared in Mesopotamia about 6,000 years ago and since then have been independently
invented in many different parts of the world. This course focuses on the pre/historical trajectories of urban development in different world regions, the multiple roles of cities, and their
impact on the development of complex societies. We attempt to understand and explain how
the city has developed and contributed to the constitution of modern society. Throughout the
course we will work on developing a working definition of the city that encompasses urbanism in all its many forms. (ANTH-103 Archaeology and the Human Past) Class 3, Credit 3

ANTH-301 
Social and Cultural Theory
This course explores influential classical and contemporary theories regarding society and culture. Students will assess the utility of different theories in addressing key enduring questions
regarding human behavior, the organization of society, the nature of culture, the relationship
between the individual and society, social control and social conflict, social groups and social
hierarchy, the operation of power, cultural and social change, and the interplay between the
global and the local. Theories will be marshaled to shed light on contemporary social and cultural phenomena and problems such as crime, violence, exploitation, modernity, and globalization.

Bodies and Culture
This course examines the body in culture, society, and history. The course material draws
on comparative approaches to the cultural construction of bodies, and the impact of ethnic,
gender, racial ideologies on body practices (i.e. surgical alteration, mutilation, beautification,
surrogacy, erotica). We will critically investigate the global formation of normative discourses of the body (regarding sexuality, AIDS/illness, reproduction, fat/food) in medical science,
consumer culture, and the mass media. The course will be discussion, writing, and project
oriented, encouraging students to acquire a range of analytic skills through a combination of
text interpretation and research. Counts toward the soc/anth degree (cultural anthro track),
international and global studies degree, the minor in soc/anth, the minor in visual studies, the
minor and immersion in women’s and gender studies, the immersion in cultural anthropology and the immersion in health and culture. (ANTH-102 Cultural Anthropology or INGS-101

Qualitative Research
Learning about social and cultural groups is a complex and ethically sensitive process. In this
course, we explore common qualitative research methods for social and cultural research. We
evaluate the utility of such methods for different purposes and contexts, including cross-cultural
contexts. We consider common ethical dilemmas in research with human subjects, the ethical responsibilities of researchers, and common techniques for minimizing risks to subjects.

ANTH-303 
Quantitative Research
The research conducted by sociologists and anthropologists generates large, complex data sets
that are difficult to interpret subjectively. Multivariate quantitative methods are an important
tool for understanding these data. This course presents an introduction to quantitative research
in sociology and anthropology: how to craft a research question and research design that utilize
quantitative data, how to select appropriate quantitative techniques and apply them, how to
present results, and how to critically evaluate quantitatively based knowledge claims. Topics
include: research design, collecting and cod-ing data, non-metric data, data screening, exploratory data analysis, selection and use of appropriate analysis techniques, comparing groups,
exploration of variance, classification, and modeling. The course features laboratory exercises
and a final project in which the student selects a research problem and data set, which they analyze and present to the class. Counts toward the sociology and anthropology major; sociology
and anthropology minor. Cross-listed with SOCI-303. (Any one of the following: ANTH-102

ANTH-310 
African Popular Cultures
For most people in Africa, participating in popular cultures may be the best or only means of
political expression. Yet, here in the United States, we rarely, if ever, have access to these forms,
nor are they sufficiently linked in our imaginations to political processes in Africa or around
the world. Rather, ideas and images about Africa come to us through the lenses of American
or European cultures and media, Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, exotic depictions in National
Geographic, or CNN images of massacres in the Sudan. These images and the discourses that
frame them tend to distance us from African experiences and expressions. By contrast, students,
in this course, will assess the links between popular cultures and politics, with special attention
to anthropological theory about African colonial and postcolonial literature, music, oral and
ritual expressive forms, and visual media, and the particular political contexts through which
they emerge and are performed. Through the popular cultures of diverse African communities, we will assess the politicization of identity, and the relations of African communities to
ethnic, national, religious and global networks. By the end of the course, students will have an
understanding of the enormous impact of popular cultures through which Africans express
political sentiments that might otherwise be suppressed. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

Cultural Images of War
This course critically examines the visual culture of war and terror in a global world from an
anthropological perspective. Representations of violence are endlessly transmitted on television, on the internet, in print media, in cinema, and recreational games to become part of our
everyday visual culture. Whether disseminated as news, documentary truth, or entertainment,
the ubiquitous encounters with images of violence require a new form of visual literacy that
not only highlights the intersection of the local and the global, but also recognizes the ways
in which visual technologies, cultural politics of memory and history, media practices, and
national ideologies intervene in the formation of a visual culture of war and terror. Counts
toward the major in international and global studies; the major in anthropology and sociology
(INGS-101 Global Studies or ANTH-102 Cultural Anthropology or permission of instructor).

Culture and Politics in Latin America
This course introduces cultures of Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean in the
context of political and economic forces that have shaped them. We examine Spanish and
Portuguese colonialism and its modern-day legacies, including ethnic inequalities, economic
vulnerability, and social unrest. We look at how art, music, and literature have engaged critically with the forces of fascism, revolution, socialism, dictatorship, and neo-colonialism. We
consider indigenous activism, religious diversity, changing experiences and expectations of
women and men, rebellion and revolution, impacts of and creative responses to globalization,
and Latinos in the U.S. Counts toward international and global studies major (Latin American
or indigenous studies tracks); sociology and anthropology major. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)
ANTH-340 
Divided Europe
As Europe strives for political and economic unity, we see a concurrent push toward inequality, exclusion, and marginalization: minorities, immigrants, refugees, Blacks, Muslims, Jews,
Roma or Sinti, and women struggle against discrimination. Not only the legacy of colonialism
but the revitalization of nationalism shape contemporary European cultural politics. Based
on an anthropological perspective, this course examines ways in which we can understand a
divided Europe through the intersections of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and religion. Counts
toward the international and global studies major and the anthropology and sociology major.

ANTH-345 
Genocide and Post-conflict Justice
The destruction and survival of societies often hinges upon the ideas and the social, cultural
constructions of identity and belonging. When ideas fail to incorporate people, essentialist
categories of identity, historical memory, and accounts of extreme violence become interrelated, potent sources of destruction. Slavery and exclusive ownership of resources leave people
starving or living in perilously polluted environments. Globalizing cultural economies threaten
local systems and self-representation. Group identities may be “sites” of crises within nationstates and global political, economic and cultural processes. In this course, we will take critical,
anthropological approaches to studies of ethnocide, genocide and post-conflict justice. Students
will use critical, anthropological approaches to assess ethnocides and genocides from the 19th
century forced assimilation and slaughter of Native Americans and Amazonian Indians to more
recent genocides in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, and the Sudan, to understand the impact of
globalization on techniques and technologies of genocides, the legal, moral/personal responsibility for genocides, media representations of genocides, and the affects of cultural, historical
memory and social, global inequities upon future genocides. Students will use anthropological
perspectives on genocide to assess post-conflict concepts of justice, reconstruction and reconciliation and local-global debates about their cultural resonance and effectiveness. Counts
toward sociology and anthropology major (cultural anthropology track). (INGS-101 Global
Studies or ANTH-102 Cultural Anthropology or permission of instructor) Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
ANTH-350 
The Global Economy and the Grassroots
Economic globalization has given birth to global, grassroots social movements. This course
examines how global economic integration is brought about through multilateral institutions,
multinational corporations, outsourcing, trade agreements, international lending, and neoliberal reforms. We consider impacts (cultural, economic, and health) of these trends on employees,
farmers, small businesses, consumers, and the environment in the developed and developing
worlds (with special emphasis on Latin America). We examine beliefs, alternative visions, and
strategies of grassroots movements responding to these challenges. Counts toward international
and global studies major (global core and Latin America track); sociology and anthropology
major. (Second year status) Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)
ANTH-355 
Historic Archaeology
This course introduces students to historic archaeology as an approach to understanding past
cultures. Historic archaeology uses the study of material evidence, in concert with documentary evidence, in a multidisciplinary approach to developing reconstructions of the past. The
course, through the study of material culture approaches, addresses a variety of issues including ethnicity and identity, colonialism and culture contact, and gender and sexuality through
a variety of readings of ethnohistorical texts and case studies on past societies. Through these
readings, and the lectures and discussions, students will develop an understanding of different
societies and their material cultures, and also learn processes of seeking multiple lines of evidence that may lead to corroborating or refuting hypotheses about historic societies. While the
readings in the course cover a number of world regions, particular emphasis is placed on case
studies drawn from the Americas. Counts toward sociology and anthropology major (archaeology track). Class 3, Credit 3 (S, biannual)
ANTH-360 
Humans and Their Environment
Humans and their societies have always been shaped by their environment, but as human
societies became more complex, their relationship with their environment changed from one
of simple adaptation to one in which they had the power to change their environment. Often,
the changes they have wrought have had unintended consequences, forcing societies to adapt
to the changes that they themselves have brought about. Although we tend to think that this is
a relatively recent phenomenon, humans have been altering their environment since the first
human societies made the transition to agriculture over ten thousand years ago, if not longer. In this class, we will use the tools of environmental archaeology to explore the history of
human interactions with their environments and to draw lessons on how we could manage
that interaction today. Counts toward the archaeology track of the sociology and anthropology
major or a general education elective. (ANTH-103 Archaeology and the Human Past) Class
3, Credit 3 (F, biannual)
ANTH-365 
Islamic Culture and the Middle East
This interdisciplinary course focuses on introducing the fundamentals of the Middle East (a
region which includes North Africa), with an emphasis on Islam, to students with little or no
prior background in the region or the culture. The framework of Islam is used to explore the significance of how religion -- with its prescriptions for and proscriptions against certain behaviors
and societal and cultural norms -- constructs and shapes ways of knowing and understanding
material and performance culture. The four themes to be addressed include: (1) Foundations
of Islam (2) Islamic Law and Islamic Sects (3) Material and Performance Culture in Islam, and
(4) Islamic Culture and the West. The rationale for this course is to help students recognize
and interpret fundamental concepts of Islamic cultures, to demonstrate how Islamic culture
has shaped technologies used in the Middle East, to encourage students’ independent thinking
about topical events concerning Islam and the Middle East within their historical perspective,
and to inspire students to examine how their own cultures change and adapt to the various
current global situations involving the Middle East. Counts toward the sociology and anthropology major (archaeology track), international and global studies major (Middle East track).

ANTH-370 
Media and Globalization
This course examines the cultural importance of mass media in the context of globalization.
By analyzing the global flows of media images across national borders, emphasis is given to the
cultural, social, and political impact of global media culture on communities in different parts
of the world. How, for example, do mass media represent or shape cultural values and beliefs
in developing societies? What is the role of mass media in forging national and ethnic identities, body images, cultural constructs of sexuality and gender, and the perceptions of war and
violence in different societies? Counts toward the major in international and global studies,
the major in anthropology and sociology. (INGS-101 Global Studies or ANTH-102 Cultural

Native American Repatriation
NAR addresses issues surrounding cultural objects, contested ownerships, repatriation, reparations, legal compliance, museum technologies and the ever-changing role of repositories.
This course facilitates experiential learning including work with the Rochester Museum and
Science Center. Lectures, round-table discussions, and instruction are provided by museum
professionals, nationally renowned speakers, and Native American representatives. At the conclusion of this course students will comprehend the breadth of federal legislation regulating
human remains and objects of cultural patrimony, the complex legal and social issues facing
museums and communities, and the opportunities that exist as NAGPRA enters into its third
decade since ratification in 1990. Counts toward the sociology and anthropology major, international and global studies major (indigenous studies track). Class 3, Credit 3 (F)
ANTH-380 
Nationalism and Identity
Nationalism is often described in terms of strong sentiments and acts of self-determination
on the part of members of a nation as distinct from the state that is necessarily a territorially
and politically defined entity. This course will explore leading theories related to the origins of
contemporary nationalism and nationalism’s importance within the context of state societies,
especially in Europe. The past as an invented historical or imagined reality will be highlighted, as invented pasts contribute to claims for exclusive national culture and both exclusive
and contested identities. The relationships between culture, literacy, and capitalism will be
applied to understanding select historical and ethnographic cases of nationalism. Class 3,
Credit 3 (varies).
ANTH-385 
Anthropology and History
This course evaluates the relationship between anthropology and history — a relationship that
is not always self-evident because of cultural anthropology’s focus largely on living peoples
and cultures and history’s emphasis on the past. The careful analysis of select texts will serve
to raise critical questions concerning the theoretical and methodological similarities and differences between the two disciplines as well as the potential contributions of anthropology
and history to critical scholarship and writing. (One course in anthropology, sociology or history) Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
ANTH-390 
Marxist Perspectives
This course will provide a critical analysis and historical overview of the Marxist tradition in
anthropology and sociology. Special attention will be given to comparing the various Marxist
schools as well as outlining the neo-Marxist project and its importance for a cultural refiguration of Marxist perspectives in the social sciences. (ANTH-102 Cultural Anthropology or

Global Cities
This course examines the impact of global dynamics on cities from the early twentieth century
to the present. By tracing urban formations from metropolis to global city, emphasis will be
placed on the making of identities, communities, and citizens in the architectural spaces, cultural places, ethnic zones, and media traces of urban life in the context of globalization. Counts
toward the major in international and global studies; the major in anthropology and sociology.

Archaeological Science
Archaeology is one of the few social sciences that lends itself well to the application of analytical
techniques from the physical sciences. This is due to the fact that archaeology relies primarily
on physical evidence; artifacts and features, whose origin, composition, age, manner of production can be elucidated through application of the physical sciences. This course examines
the application of physical science techniques to archaeological questions, including the age
and origin of materials; how things are made; what people ate; their daily activities; and their
state of health throughout their life. The course will include in-class labs in which students
have the opportunity to apply some of these techniques and a final research project in which
the student picks their own archaeological question to answer. Counts toward the archaeology track of the sociology and anthropology major or a general education elective. (ANTH-103

Exploring Ancient Technology
While it is commonplace to describe the present era as one dominated by technology, humans
have been critically dependent on technology for as long as we have existed as a species. Some
of today’s key technologies such as ceramics, woodworking, textiles, glass, and metals, were
invented before the dawn of recorded history. In this class, we will explore these ancient technologies; how they came to be invented, how they evolved, and how they were integrated
into the social and economic life of ancient and modern peoples. This course features lectures and readings on ancient technology and experimental archaeology. Key concepts and
themes will be explored in a series of hands-on labs in which students will seek to replicate,
and understand, a variety of ancient technologies. The course concludes with either, an individual project, such as replicating a particular artifact or process, or a class project, such as
building and using a Mesopotamian glass furnace. Counts toward the archaeology track of the
sociology and anthropology major. (ANTH-103 Archaeology and the Human Past) Class 2,

Global Sexualities
This course explores issues of gender and sexuality in a global context. Students will be introduced to anthropological perspectives on the experience of men and women, as gendered
subjects, in different societies and historical contexts such as colonialism, nationalism, and
global capitalism. In turn, we will explore how cultural constructions of masculinity and femininity are configured by race, class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Course materials are
drawn from an array of sources, reflecting various theoretical perspectives and ethnographic
views from different parts of the world. Counts toward the major in international and global
studies and the major in anthropology and sociology. (ANTH-102 Cultural Anthropology or

Visual Anthropology
We see others as we imagine them to be, in terms of our values, not as they see themselves.
This course examines ways in which we understand and represent the reality of others through
visual media, across the boundaries of culture, gender, and race. It considers how and why
visual media can be used to represent or to distort the world around us. Pictorial media, in
particular ethnographic film and photography, are analyzed to document the ways in which
indigenous and native peoples in different parts of the world have been represented and imagined by anthropologists and western popular culture. Part of the major in international and

Survey of Metallurgy
This course introduces students to the study of metallurgy as both culture and science. We
begin with a survey of the archaeological evidence of the earliest uses of metals around the
globe, and continue with an examination of the role of mining and metal technology as documented in early metallurgical treatises. From there, we explore the symbolism and meanings
of metallurgical extraction technologies as presented in ethnographic accounts, and use this
information to derive the scientific equations which govern the series of reactions of these technologies. We also examine basic metal refining and working techniques and, through the study
of phase equilibrium diagrams, learn to interpret the microstructures of ancient and modern
metal samples. Students should emerge from the course understanding the values, traditions,
and development of metallurgical techniques employed by both ancient and modern societies
around the globe. Counts toward the sociology and anthropology major (archaeology track).

Honors Microeconomics
This course introduces students to some of the important questions addressed in
Microeconomics and the methodology used to address these questions. We will look at some
of the basic models of consumer and firm behavior and study how implications are derived
from these. We will also see how some of these simple models give insight into diverse questions such as: Should food stamps be given away freely to those who are poor, or should they
be required to purchase them? Why are general practitioners (as opposed to specialists) disproportionately located in smaller towns? Why do firms bundle goods rather than just selling
them separately? As far as the final impact is concerned, is there a difference in whether a tax is
imposed on the sellers of a product or on buyers of a product? Microeconomics gives the tools
to understand and evaluate implications of government as well as business policy decisions. In
addition, it provides the foundation for the study of many other sub-disciplines in economics.

Principles of Macroeconomics
Macroeconomics studies aggregate economic behavior. The course begins by presenting the
production possibilities model. This is followed by a discussion of basic macroeconomic concepts including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth and fluctuations. The next
topic is national income accounting, which is the measurement of macroeconomic variables.
The latter part of the course focuses on the development of one or more macroeconomic models,
a discussion of the role of money in the macroeconomy, the aggregate supply-aggregate demand
framework, and other topics the individual instructor may choose. (ECON-101 Principles of

ECON-402 
Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory
The central question of macroeconomics is the determination of output, employment and
prices. This course develops models which incorporate behavioral assumptions concerning
consumption, investment, and the role of money and their relationship to macroeconomic
variables. Macroeconomics, unlike microeconomics, has been in a constant state of flux during the 20th and into the 21st century. Theories which purport to explain macroeconomic
behavior have come into and gone out of fashion depending upon institutional changes and
external factors. This course will primarily focus on examining four macroeconomic theories;
the Classical, Keynesian, Monetarist, and New Classical models. In addition, macroeconomic
public policy will be analyzed in the context of recent economic history. This analysis will be
extended to consider open economy macroeconomics in a global context. (ECON-101 Principles

Game Theory With Economic Applications
Game theory uses a mathematical approach to study situations of strategic interdependence,
i.e., situations with two or more players in which each player’s decision influences payoffs of
other players and players are aware of this fact when making their decisions. Game theory
has been applied to understand diverse economic, political and biological phenomena. We
will study how to formulate situations of strategic interdependence as game theoretic models;
how to explain/predict behavior of the parties involved, through the use of various equilibrium concepts; and/or identify guidelines for appropriate behavior. The concepts and methods
will be illustrated with many examples. The objective is to introduce you to language of game

Literary Diseases
This course takes a literary approach to a set of broad humanist questions about how we represent illness and disease in imaginative forms. It explores the links between narrative, disease,
and culture by focusing on works of fiction, drama, film, and non-fiction media that represent
disease and illness. As early as ancient Greek drama, diseases have been key metaphors and
framing narratives in literature. The course allows students to see how narrative has been an
important part of accounting for and analyzing disease both at the individual and epidemiological levels. The course will also allow students to see how diseases are turned into metaphors,
and how and why this transformation can we should think critically about such metaphors.
Students are encouraged to think critically about how illness is deployed for social and political purposes when, for instance, “infection” is used as a metaphor for immigration or invasion.

History of Madness
This course will study the changes in definitions, explanations, and depictions of madness as
expressed in psychiatric texts, asylum records, novelists, cartoonists, artists, photographers,
filmmakers—and patient narratives. Certainly, madness has assumed many names and forms:
the sacred disease, frenzy, hysteria, mania, melancholy, neurosis, dementia, praecox, schizophrenia, phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder. Those afflicted have been admired, pitied,
mocked, hidden from public view, imprisoned, restrained, operated on, hospitalized, counseled, analyzed, and medicated. The brain, particularly the disordered brain, has long been a
source of interest. This course explores the brain from the history of madness. The course takes
a humanist, rhetorical, and historicist approach to the question of madness within changing
social institutions and popular discourse. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

Language, Dialects, and Identity
This course is an introduction to sociolinguistic theory, application and methodology with a
focus on the U.S. context. We will examine varieties of language that result from regional and
social factors (gender, race, ethnicity and class). We will also explore the ways in which language is tied to our identity and marks our place in society as a result of such variation. Topics
could include but are not limited to: dialects of American English, language and gender, bi/
multilingualism, attitudes toward non-standard and standard varieties of English and language
policy (e.g. the movement to declare English the national language; African American English/
Ebonics). Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)
ENGL-374 
Games and Literature
Who studies game studies? Writing in games can often be hit or miss, so relying on an established story can provide support and allows the medium to evolve to cover more interesting
stories than the typical mass-offering affairs. Still, literature and games are fundamentally different media- and as such these differences must be accounted for when mapping literature onto
video games. Will “game studies” ever be as highly regarded as is critical scholarship on, say,
literature? Can a video game possess substantial literary merit? Can a video game offer the same
depth of characters and insight into the human condition as a novel? Do video games invite the
player to do the same things that works of great literature invite the reader to do: identify with
the characters, invite him to judge them and quarrel with them, and to experience their joys
and sufferings as the reader’s own? In this course we will have these conversations and then
go beyond. We will examine works that have visually evocative and varied settings; narratives
that make readers wonder what is going to happen next; and a rapidly changing culture that
prompts even more questions than it answers. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
ENGL-375 
Storytelling Across Media
This course introduces the basic elements of narrative, reflecting on key concepts in narrative theory such as — story and plot, narration and focalization, characterization, storyspace,
and worldmaking — to enhance your understanding of how stories work and your ability to
understand how such storytelling strategies convey their meaning and themes. After an initial
exploration of storytelling traditions emerging from oral myth and short stories in print, we
expand our inquiries into what a narrative is and what it can do by considering what happens
to storytelling in graphic novels, digital games, and in recent electronic literature. Reflecting
on competing definitions and varieties of narrative, the course raises the overarching question
of why how we access, read, write, and circulate stories as a culture matters. Expect to “read”
stories in a variety of media, to review basic concepts and conversations drawn from narrative
theory, and to creatively experiment with the storytelling strategies we are analyzing in class.
No familiarity with specific print, digital, or visual media necessary, though a willingness to
read and reflect on stories in various media and to analyze their cultural significance will be
essential. (ENGL 150, UWRT-150, or equivalent) Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)

ENGL-376 
Experimental Writing
Is it true that literature makes nothing happen? Experimental writing is built on the opposite
assumption! This course introduces students to innovative texts that challenge our usual ways
of thinking about the relationship of language to the world: the cultural contexts within which
language functions, the conflicts out of which it arises, the aesthetic pleasures with which it is
associated, and the purposes — intentional or other — which it serves. Writing experiments
can test boundaries and break limits, offering us ways to reconsider and redefine our own
experience —social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual. Moving from magic to modernity, from
monster to machine, we will explore the transformative power of experimental writing. Students
are expected to post weekly responses to the readings in Discussions on MyCourses, work with
a group to research and prepare a class presentation on a significant experimental writer, and
submit a final paper on a theme to be announced. Expect reading quizzes and a take-home final
exam. (Completion of First Year Writing) Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)
ENGL-381 
Science Writing
Study of and practice in writing about science, environment, medicine and technology for
audiences ranging from the general public to scientists and engineers. Starts with basic science
writing for lay audiences, emphasizing writing strategies and techniques. Also explores problems of conveying highly complex technical information to multiple audiences, factors that
influence science communication to the public, and interactions between scientists and journalists. The course examines new opportunities for covering science (especially on the Internet),
important ethical and practical constraints that govern the reporting of scientific information,
and the cultural place of science in our society. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)
ENGL-391 
Dangerous Texts
This course will examine how suppression of information has been orchestrated throughout
history in different contexts. The process of suppressing information —of people in power
attempting to hide images, sounds and words— must itself be viewed in perspective. We must
recognize acts of censorship in relation to their social settings, political movements, religious
beliefs, cultural expressions and/or personal identities. The texts that we will study were all
considered dangerous enough to be banned by governments. They are dangerous because they
represent sexuality, race, politics, and religion in ways that challenge the current political/cultural norms of their given culture. What, then, is so dangerous about a fictional representation?
What is it that makes a certain work dangerous at a particular time and how does this danger
manifest itself in stories, novels (print and graphic), and poetry? Studying these dangerous
texts and watching some dangerous films we will ask: what features of political and cultural
regimes do artists tend to single out for criticism? What is the range of expressive tools they
use, including the contemporary context of digital media? What is it that makes intellectuals in
general and imaginative writers in particular so potent a threat to established power? Do issues
like these matter only in totalitarian regimes, or can we learn something about the book-banning pressures in our own society? How do social media technologies complicate discussions
of censorship and creativity? Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)

Shakespeare: Tragedies
For almost four hundred years Shakespeare’s work has stood as a monument to the literary
imagination. In this course, we will study Shakespeare’s tragedies with a view toward exploring the influence of his work through the ages, as well as addressing questions of canonicity.
Through class discussion, interactive activities, and examination of film, students will develop strategies both to investigate the literary and theatrical power of these works as well as to
consider their cultural presence in both contemporary American culture and Shakespeare’s
England. Particular attention will be devoted to literary theory and the variety of interpretation in order to inform readings of the plays. Part of the literary and cultural studies immersion

Shakespeare: Comedies
Our notions of comedy are considerably different than Shakespeare’s time. Yet, the parameters
set forth in his plays continue to influence the way we understand the form. In this course,
we will read a selection of Shakespeare’s comedies including some problem plays in order to
develop an understanding of genre and its influence. Through class discussion, collaborative
activities, and examination of films, students will develop strategies both to investigate the
literary and theatrical power of these works as well as to consider their cultural presence in
both contemporary American culture and Shakespeare’s England. Particular attention will be
devoted to literary theory and a variety of interpretations that inform readings of the plays.

Modern Poetry
From Walt Whitman’s “barbaric yawp,” to Emily Dickinson’s “letter to the world that never
wrote to me,” and Baudelaire’s “breath of wind from the wings of madness,” Modern Poetry
is a body of literature characterized by bold changes in voice, form, and subject matter. This
course offers a close examination of poetry of the 19th and 20th centuries, with attention to
such things as the role played by technological, historical, and political developments; what it
means to be “modern” and how other modern arts movements, for instance, visual arts, music,
or film, have influenced poetry. Part of the literary and cultural studies immersion and minor;
the creative writing minor; and may also be taken as an elective. Class 3, Credit 3 (annually).

Mythology and Literature
This course is a scholarly investigation into the cultural, historical, social, psychological, religious and spiritual, literary and performative dimensions of world myth. It examines different
approaches to the study of myth emerging from disciplines such as anthropology, history, literary studies, and psychology. Special attention will be paid to the effects of these narratives on
literature and other kinds of cultural texts, past and present. We will also use myth to develop,
and critically reflect on, comparative approaches to world cultures. Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)

Topics in American Literature
The course introduces students to American literature by tracing a particular theme through
a historical survey of canonical, non-canonical, and contemporary novels, stories, poetry, and
drama, as well as non-fiction forms (speeches, autobiographies, essays, etc.). Students will gain
a broad understanding of American literary trends while also gaining a deep understanding
of the given themes. These themes will be broadly conceived, but will also lend themselves to
social, cultural, and political questions. These themes may include but are not limited to horror, gardens and machines, natives and strangers, borders, etc. While these themes deal with
abstract or conceptual ideas, they lead to questions about gender, race, ethnicity, empire, and
other historical problems in debates over American exceptionalism, empire, and ideology.

ENGL-412 
American Studies
American studies is a crossroads space where American culture and history are studied from
multiple perspectives. It offers a glimpse into a big picture of America through literary, historical, and cultural snapshots of American life. It asks students to think in relational ways.
What did it mean, for example, to be an American in 1953 and how is that experience different from today? How are the ideals of America as the land of liberty and freedom perceived at
home and in the world? How do national politics shape literary formations? This version of
the course focuses on American literature of the 1950s that decade wedged between the end
of World War II and the beginning of the psychedelic 1960s. Through literature, film, photography, and popular culture we develop a deeper understanding of the complex and shifting
meanings of American identity, individually and nationally. Assignments include investigations of key words, literary analysis, oral history, researched essays and student presentations.
By holding a mirror up to a single decade we also expand our awareness and understanding of
our own times. Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)

Topics in Women’s and Gender Studies
This course will explore a key theme or critical question in Women’s and Gender Studies as an
introduction and line of inquiry into how and why women’s and gender studies matter in the
contemporary world and in our individual lives. Drawing from and reflecting on approaches
to women’s and gender studies from a variety of disciplines and cultures, we will use these
theoretical lenses to read social, cultural, and artistic texts and cultural practices in a new light.
How do cultural texts and practices (such as novels, graphic novels, plastic surgery, invitro
fertilization, music videos, bulimia, facebook, video games, advertising, etc.) encourage us to
think about gender, sex, sexuality, race, class, nation, transnation, science and power? What
role do they play in processes of identity formation? How do power-laden ideas of gender,
sexuality, race and class travel from culture to culture or refuse an easy translation? What old
and new discourses of gender, sex, sexuality, race, colonialism, or biopower do these texts help
in, or resist disseminating? How has women’s and gender studies and the creative, activist and
academic practices theorized in this multidisciplinary, global space, challenged gendered and
racialized power structures in the past, in the present, and how might it transform its methods
to confront current challenges? What connections can be drawn between women around the
world without erasing their distinct differences? How do we put that international perspective on women’s and men’s lives into practice in our own daily lives? Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

images and writing function in relation to one another. Primary readings will be supplemented with secondary works that address socio-historical contexts, interpretive approaches and
the cultural politics of the medium, such as representations of class, race, gender and ethnicity. Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)

Maps, Spaces and Places
This course takes as its premise that spatial thinking is critically important. Spatial thinking
informs our ability to understand many areas of 21st century culture, as mobile interfaces and
geospatial technologies enable us to engage with our surroundings in new ways. The study
begins with a meditation on the language of maps and mapmaking, and how they work, and
explores the idea that to present a useful and truthful picture, an accurate map must tell lies.
The course develops into an exploration of the ways, particularly in texts, that mapmaking
creates cultural routes, mobile forms of ethnography, and ways of imagining travel and tourism in the era of globalization. The proliferation of location-aware mobile devices calls for
new understanding of space and networks of power, as we define public space and locational
privacy. The diverse writers, critics and filmmakers represented in this course are rethinking
space as a dynamic context for the making of history and for different organizations of social
and communal life. Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)

Global Cinemas
This course introduces students to one or more national or regional motion picture (including
video and digital formats) traditions other than North American (Hollywood) film (though
even this film tradition may be examined in its global significance). While the rest of the world
is exposed to American cinema extensively, we in North America have only recently been
exposed to film from China, Latin America, Iran, and other non-Western film traditions. Even
European cinema (East and West) remains little understood among mainstream movie audiences. This course increases students’ awareness of at least one cinematic tradition beyond
that of mainstream North American cinema. Lectures and readings will situate the films within
the broader socio-historical context of the national, regional, or ethnic tradition. Students will
become familiar with the aesthetic of a particular national cinema, including its connections
with other art forms from the region and elsewhere. Moreover, students will become familiar
with the inherently transnational nature of most cinema, including the significance and limits of such transnationalism. The specific focus of the course will vary depending on faculty
offering the course. Current areas of expertise within the department include Middle Eastern
cinema, Iranian cinema, Japanese film and anime, Chinese cinema, Honk Kong films. Class

Editing the Literary Magazine
This seminar-style course seeks to introduce students to the editorial profession and will focus
on questions of literary judgment: How do we assess literature? What is the importance of the
literary magazine as genre? Several class periods will be devoted to examination of the history
and cultural significance of the “small magazine” over the course of the past century. Students
will also consider the history of student magazines at RIT (available in the RIT Archives), and
technological innovations, such as the “mimeograph revolution” of the 1960s, the subsequent
desktop publishing revolution, and contemporary Internet magazines. Finally, students will
discuss what professional editors themselves have to say regarding their craft, their criteria
for selection, and the decisions they constantly face. Work on the staff of Signatures Magazine,
RIT’s award-winning art and literary magazine, is one option for final projects. Class 3, Credit

Free and Open Source Culture
This course charts the development of the Free Culture movement by examining the changing
relationship between authorship and cultural production based on a variety of factors: law,
culture, commerce and technology. In particular, we will examine the rise of the concept of
the individual author during the last three centuries. Using a variety of historical and theoretical readings, we will note how law and commerce have come to shape the prevailing cultural
norms surrounding authorship, while also examining lesser known models of collaborative
and distributed authoring practices. This background will inform our study of the rapid social
transformations wrought by media technologies in last two centuries, culminating with the
challenges and opportunities brought forth by digital media, mobile communications and
networked computing. Students will learn about the role of software in highlighting changing
authorship practices, facilitating new business and economic models and providing a foundation for conceiving of open source, open access, participatory, peer-to-peer and free cultures.

Writing the Self and Other
This course focuses on forms of writing that address notions of self and other. The forms may
be linear narratives, constructed projects such as artist books, or digitally mediated texts that
incorporate images, text, video and audio files. Students learn about the relationships between
orality, image, and text, and about how we know ourselves through others, and others through
ourselves. This course emphasizes the reflective process of memoir, autoethnography, and
autobiography, moving from short exercises into longer, peer-reviewed texts. Students read
from culturally diverse memoirs and oral histories, conduct research online, in databases and
archives, or through interviews, and view documentaries. This course can be taken as a writing elective, as part of the writing studies minor, as an elective for the communication major,

American Film Since the Sixties
This course examines the history and aesthetics of the motion picture in the United States since
the late 1960s, when the classical studio era ended. Emphasis will be placed on the analysis
of both the work of major American filmmakers and the evolution of major American film
genres between 1967 and 2001. Among the filmmakers to be studied are Kazan, Cassavetes,
Penn, Coppola, Scorsese, Spielberg, Allen, Seidelman, Lee, Burton, Altman, Tarantino, Coen,
and Lynch. The course will consider the evolution of such traditional Hollywood genres as the
gangster film, the romantic comedy, and the Hollywood movie, study the development of new,
blended genres, investigate the rise of the blockbuster, explore the rise of the Independents, and
follow the aesthetic changes that occurred since the 1967. The films will be studied within the
context of contemporary cultural and political events, and will be discussed from several viewpoints, including aesthetic, technical, social, and economic. The ways in which gender, race, and
class are constructed through the movies will also be a major focus of study. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

Art in the Age of the New Deal
In this course we examine art in the age of the New Deal; that is, the art of the 1920’s and
the 1930's, with a particular emphasis on the artwork produced through the programs of the
Roosevelt Administration’s New Deal. These programs sponsored the visual arts, as well as
film, theater, literature, music and dance. We study the art produced through this sponsorship in the context of the evolution of twentieth century modernism, mostly European, that
had begun to influence American art. We will look at the stylistic and ideological affinities of
the figurative style, known as the American scene, with the Mexican muralists of the 1920’s
and examine other government-sponsored social realist art of the 1930's, notably German and
Russian. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
FNRT-375 Women/Gender/Art
This course examines the role of women in the visual arts as both images makers and subject
matter in order to see how gender plays a role in the conceptualization of creativity and art.
Among the topics to be discussed are: the construction of femininity and gender in the patriarchy; art as an ideological practice; women, art, and society; art history, art education, and art
evaluation; women artists and their contemporaries. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
FNRT-376 
Visual Culture Theory
Visual culture studies recognize the predominance of visual forms of media, communication,
and information in the contemporary world, investigating both high cultural forms such as
fine art, design, and architecture and popular low cultural forms associated with mass media
and communications. Visual culture studies represents a turn in the discourse of the visual,
which had focused on content-based, critical readings of images, and has since broadened
its approach to additionally question the ways in which our consumption and production of
images and image based technologies are structured. Analyzing images from a social-historical perspective, visual culture asks: what are the effects of images? Can the visual be properly
investigated with traditional methodologies, which have been based on language, not imagery? How do images visualize social difference? How are images viewed by varied audiences?
How are images embedded in a wider culture and how do they circulate? Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

	

FNRT-377 
Imag(in)ing Rochester
This course examines the ways in which culture, ethnicity, languages, traditions, governance,
policies, and histories interact in the production of the visual experience. We will approach
the campus of RIT and the city of Rochester and their various urban spatial forms as image
experiences, subject to interpretative strategies and the influence of other discourses. We will
wander the well-traveled and the unbeaten paths, participating in and interrogating a wide
range of our campus’ and city’s treasures and embarrassments, secrets and norms. In addition
to these field trips, we will be reading from literature and cultural studies, as well as viewing
films, advertisements and websites, and possibly attending theatrical and music performances
or sporting events. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
FNRT-378 
Memory, Memorials, Monuments
In this course we examine the public remembering and memorialization of historic events that
leads to memorials and monuments in the fields of architecture, sculpture and film. We begin
by examining the nature of memory, and specifically of collective memory, and its relationship
to historical events and its subsequent transformation in the process of memorialization. We
then look at examples of the sculptural monument, a traditional form of memorial, and the
evolution of its vocabulary in the second half of the 20th century. We also examine the memorial work undertaken by those museums whose primary function is to engage in remembering
historical events, a recent phenomenon in the field of museum building. We screen films and
examine how documentaries and dramatizations engage the spectator by remembering history
differently. The course culminates by examining the debates surrounding the remembering of
9/11 and of more recent traumatic events. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

Traumatic Images
This course investigates visual culture and its imagistic response to life’s crises. Problems of
identity and identification will be explored and confronted through works of photography,
painting, mixed media, new media, and film of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. Beginning
with the late 19th Century vogue for images of hysterical women, crippled black-sheep family
members and dead loved ones (as corpses and as ghosts), we then move on to consider the last
century’s fascination with pain and suffering, disease and violence, struggle and survival and
then the 21st century’s emphasis on terrorism. Specifically, we will focus on the gendering of
images and imaging as disturbing pictures work to defy the formal and theoretical distinction
between private and public, personal and collective experience and manage the often conflicting responsibilities to self, family, religion, race, nation, and society. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

History
HIST-101 
Making History
How do historians understand and interpret the past? What tools do historians use to uncover
the past? What does it mean to think historically? History is both an art and a science, and in this
course, we will learn the methods, practices, and tools used to create historical knowledge. You
will learn how to read texts with an eye toward their argument, how to ask historical questions,
how to conduct historical research, and how to write a historical narrative. At the discretion
of the instructor, the class may use examples from a particular historical era to ground course
concepts in a specific historical tradition. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)

The City in History
This course offers an introduction to the study of history by exploring the history of a particular city. Cities are complicated places, where many peoples, cultures, and histories overlap
and interact. Their histories are also shaped by many forces, economic, cultural, demographic,
social, sexual, operating at levels from local to national to global. Studying a city offers a window into the history of a local place as well as a nation. The choice of the city is left up to the
individual professor. Cities under study in the past have included Rochester, NY, Las Vegas,
NV, and Paris, France. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
HIST-125 				
Public History and Public Debate
In late 1994, the B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay—the airplane that dropped the first atomic
bomb detonated in combat on Hiroshima, Japan—arrived at the Smithsonian National Air and
Space Museum in Washington, D.C. The museum’s staff faced important questions: Would
they celebrate the Enola Gay as the weapon that ended the Pacific War? Would they exhibit it
as a technological artifact that marked the dawn of nuclear warfare? Would they remind museum visitors that its potent cargo ended the lives of tens of thousands of people? These were
difficult professional questions for public historians; they were deeply ethical questions, too.
Much of the past that public historians interpret is the source of great debate in the present.
Since the way history is remembered shapes public policy, community identity, and collective
understanding, the ethical stakes for public history are high. This course will examine notable
controversies in American public history and develop students’ critical perspectives on them.
Students will generate answers to the questions: What are the ethics of doing public history?
What happens when public historians remember, but the community wants to forget? When
stakeholders (e.g., historic site, community, historians, sponsors) collide, whose stories and
whose interests prevail? Who decides? How are those decisions made? Who is allowed to tell
history? To whom or to what are public historians responsible? Credit 3, Class 3 (F)
HIST-160 
History of Modern East Asia
Understanding the history of East Asia is integral to understanding the complex world that we
live in, and will help us to understand that no single nation can live in isolation. One cannot
endeavor to understand limited national entities alone; rather one must understand the interactions between cultures and across borders that help to define the world. Japan, for example,
cannot be adequately understood without reference to China, Korea, and one might argue, the
wider world. Therefore, we will undertake in this course to examine the region of East Asia
historically from about 1600 to the present, paying special attention to interactions between
the cultures and people of the region. Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)
HIST-170 
Twentieth Century Europe
This course examines major themes and controversies in European history from 1900 to the
present, placing particular emphasis on the early 20th century crisis of liberal democracy and
the political alternatives proposed to parliamentary government: right-wing nationalism, communism, and fascism. Topics will include: the impact of World War I on European societies and
politics; Popular Front movements in France and Spain; eugenics and the Nazi racial state; the
Holocaust; occupation and resistance during World War II; decolonization; student rebellions
in 1968; Cold War domestic politics; and the reshaping of post-communist and post-colonial
Europe. Special attention will be placed racial politics and immigration, state surveillance
regimes, and European debates over the Americanization and globalization of European cultures. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)
HIST-180 
Information Revolution
The Internet and cell phones seem to have revolutionized our society, changing how we
learn about new things, relate to each other and understand ourselves. This course investigates the history of information and communication technologies to cast new light on these
developments. We will ask how people formed political opinions, what ethical concerns new
information and communication technologies raised, and how technologies changed the lives
of the people using them. This course helps students understand the social, cultural, and ethical
implications of revolutionary information and communication technologies. Class 3, Credit

The History of the Family in the U.S.
The family is at the center of contemporary political debates involving social policies, gender
roles, citizenship, marriage, and the role of the state. Politicians and commentators frequently
invoke a mythical American family, one that is conflict-free, independent, and unchanging.
These idealized depictions mask a far more complicated and richer historical reality of the
development of family structures in the U.S. This course will examine both the diverse experiences of actual families in the American past, and changing ideologies about the family and
its social role. Students will have the opportunity to write a history of their own family, or to

Survey of American Military History
This course is a survey of military history and will study the interaction between society and
military institutions, technology and techniques, from 1637 to the present. Additionally, the
course will examine the interrelationships of warfare, technology and society in American history. The course will focus on such questions as how changing styles of warfare, the composition
of the military establishment (militias, citizen armies, paid professionals, mercenaries), and
the transformations in military technology have impacted upon state and society. Conversely,
it will also investigate how political and societal changes have influenced the nature of warfare
in American history.Class 3, Credit 3 (F, S)

Histories of Globalization
This course examines narratives of globalization as human process. We will focus on contemporary and historical issues that are routinely conceived of as affecting or pertaining to the world’s
population in its entirety, such as human rights, humanitarianism, environmental degradation,
trade, and military power. The world and its population will feature as a unit of analysis, and
an emphasis will be placed on issues that appear to be in tension with the role of the nationstate and nationality, and highlight world and global citizenship. We will explore critiques of
the conceptualization of globality and worldliness as a factor in determining social, cultural,
and historical change. Cross-listed with INGS-201. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

Introduction to Africa and the Diaspora
This course is an introduction to the study of an enormous continent, Africa and its Diaspora.
Because of the dimensions of the geography, population and time covered, one of the main purposes of this course is to pave the way to narrower regional or thematic classes. This course will
emphasize the interdisciplinarity of African and Diaspora studies. We will explore contrasting
and complementing disciplinary perspectives on Africa and its Diaspora. We will move our
way through African and Diasporic cultures and histories both temporally and thematically.
Lectures will introduce key themes and ideas, and you will discuss textual and visual evidence
for African and Diasporic communities, cultures and ideas. This course is suitable to those new
to the study of Africa and its Diaspora, and to those who are considering taking further classes
or seminars in African and/or Diasporic studies. Part of the international and global studies
major in a related track; the sociology and anthropology immersion; and the Africa and the
Diaspora immersion. Cross-listed with INGS-210. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

Introduction to Public History
Public history is using the research-based methods and techniques of historians to conduct
historical work in the public sphere. If you've gone to a museum, conducted an oral history,
researched your old house, or learned from an interpreter at a park or historic site, you've seen
public history in action. This course will introduce students to the wide variety of careers in
public history, and will examine the challenges and opportunities that come with doing history in, with, and for the public. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

Deaf People in Global Perspective
This course explores the history of the deaf community in global perspective from the 18th
to the 20th centuries. It takes a comparative approach, exploring the histories of deaf people
from around the globe, including deaf lives in Central America, Europe, Africa, and East Asia.
Special attention will be given to the major events in European deaf history, as Europe was
the site for the first schools for the deaf in the history of the world, and the world’s first documented deaf culture, in France, emerged there as well. The spread of deaf education, the rise
of indigenous signed languages, the birth of deaf-hood, and the fight for human rights will all
be placed in a global context. Class 3, Credit 3 (bi-annually)

History of Disability
This course will explore the meaning of disability in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The
course provides a cultural overview of disability and seeks to explore the social construction of
disability, with special attention given to the cultural, intellectual, personal, and social histories
of disability. Disability in history has been many (frequently contradictory) things: acquired
at birth and acquired by war; a reason to promote eugenic policies or a reason to promote civil
rights legislation; a medical diagnosis or a personal identity; visible in the body (as in the case
of amputations) or invisible (as in the case of deafness); a source of family shame or a source
of personal pride. How has the meaning and nature of disability changed over time? How can
we understand the cultural meaning of the body in history? The course seeks to explore and
explain these shifting meanings of disabil-ity within the context of Western history. Specific
topics to be considered include freak shows, disabled veterans, prosthetic technologies, disability as culture, the history of eugenics, and political activism. Class 3, Credit 3 (biannually)

History of Modern China
China occupies a rather large place in the consciousness of most Americas. It is the most populous country in the world, it has one of the biggest economies in the world and, in many ways,
China has been seen to be in direct competition with America. Whatever the truth of these ideas,
it is clear that China will play a major role on the world stage for the foreseeable future. This
class will seek to analyze the historical circumstances surrounding the rise of modern China.
What were the conditions that led to the establishment of, first, Nationalist China, followed by
the People’s Republic; why did the communist government enjoy such popular support; what
were China’s relations with the outside world; and finally, what is the state of China today?
These are all questions that we will seek to answer in this course. Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)

History of Premodern Japan
This class will introduce students to the history of Japan from the earliest times to the opening
of the country in the mid-19th century. Through a variety of readings, discussions, and lectures, we'll tackle issues such as the origin of the Japanese people, early state formation, Japan
in the larger East Asian context, and the rise of the warriors. We'll also examine the unique
dual form of government that existed in Japan from the 12th century, consisting of rule by the
imperial court as well as by the warrior class in Japan, the well-known samurai. And finally,
we'll look at several of the modern myths of Japanese history and try to address them in a balanced, historical manner. Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)

Screening the Trenches: the History of WWI Through Film
This course uses popular films to examine World War I as the global conflict that set the stage
for the rise of communism, fascism, and subsequent wars in 20th century Europe. Students
will gain an understanding of the major causes and outcomes of World War I while investigating how the war transformed class, gender, and racial politics in Europe. Special attention
will be paid to the combat/trench experience, the home front/war front divide, the German
occupation of Belgium and Northern France, total war, the politics of shell-shock and disability, and the legacies of grief, mourning, and commemoration. Because World War I so greatly
divided its participants, little consensus about the war’s meaning emerged in its aftermath.
Filmmakers have consequently used World War I as a blank slate on which to project political fantasies, condemn elements of their own societies, or imagine the future. Students will
use secondary historical literature and original primary sources to analyze filmic representations of World War I and consider how filmmakers have deliberately misrepresented the past
or constructed particular narratives about the war to serve their own ends. This course will
therefore equip students to think critically about representations of the historical past in popular culture. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

Global Slavery and Human Trafficking
This course examines historical and contemporary dimensions of global slavery and human
trafficking. The trans-Atlantic slave trade was the world’s largest forced migration between
continents, but it was only one of many slave trades that shaped societies throughout the world.
In order to understand the historical significance of global slave trades, we will compare it
to other systems of slavery. In examining the historical significance and legacies of the slave
trade, we will link different regional histories to the growth of market-based capitalist economies into the 20th century. The course will also examine the changing meaning of the term
slavery and examine some modern forms of forced labor, bondage, and slavery that persist
to this day in all sectors of the global economy. We will explore the rise of human trafficking,
and global anti-trafficking programs and campaigns. Part of the international and global studies major in a related track; the sociology and anthropology immersion; and the Africa and

Monuments are physical objects that were constructed to help us remember the past, but
a deeper analysis reveals that the relationship between monuments and the memories they
embody is complex and changes over time. We will tackle the process of memorializing, the
monuments that result, and seek greater insight into the arguments these artifacts make about
the past, the present, and our place in the world. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)

Oral History
Oral history is the craft of collecting information about the past from those who lived through it.
There are few opportunities for historical research that is more satisfying or more challenging
than oral history. In this class, we will learn about oral history methods, techniques, and ethics. We will read some of the finest examples of the genre. Then we will go out and add to the
world’s understanding of its past by conducting oral histories of our own. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)

Doing History in a Digital World
Digital history is a nebulous concept, but at its core is a recognition that the widespread availability of computers and their networks has fundamentally altered the way history is produced
and consumed. Sources in digital format simultaneously present opportunities and challenges
that force us to rethink what is possible in history. Digital tools including blogs, wikis, video

HIST-330 
Deafness and Technology
The deaf community has a long and complicated relationship with technological devices. The
deaf community, for instance, was quick to embrace the new technology of moving pictures,
and many deaf actors found work in early Hollywood during the silent film era. Most lost
their livelihoods when sound was introduced to motion pictures. Deaf people were left out of
the communication revolution brought about by the telephone for many years, but now the
deaf community is increasingly a wired community, as texting, tweeting, and blogging makes
more communication technologies accessible to deaf users. This course will explore the historical relationship between technology and deafness. It will consider how views of deafness
frequently shape technology, that is, if deafness is viewed as a pathological illness, technologies
are focused on curing it (e.g., cochlear implants), whereas, if deaf people are viewed as members
of linguistic and cultural minority, technologies are harnessed to make it easier for that minority to interact with the majority culture (e.g, relay systems). It will consider how deaf people
have used, created, and adopted technologies to their own ends. It will also explore the complicated, and controversial, relationship between Deaf people and medical technologies such as
hearing aids, cochlear implants, and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Class 3, Credit 3 (biannually)

Diversity in the Deaf Community
Students in this course will be introduced to the study of diversity in the Deaf community related to race, ethnicity, sexuality and other factors. Students will learn to analyze the implications
of such diversity in terms of self-perception, self-esteem, and acculturation. Students also will
learn how the Deaf experience transcends race, ethnicity and other factors to bond members
of the Deaf community and help define Deaf culture. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)

Oppression in the Lives of Deaf People
Students in this course will examine various forms of oppression across different cultures and

to resistance and the struggle for social justice. Finally, students will examine and apply experiences of other minority groups in recent history to the Deaf community. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)
HIST-335 
Women and the Deaf Community
Deaf history, as a field, has often neglected the story of deaf women. Scholar Arlene B. Kelly
has recently asked, Where is deaf herstory? This course seeks to correct that gender imbalance
in deaf history. We will study deaf women’s history. This will include a consideration of deafblind women, as well, as women like Helen Keller were often the most famous deaf women of
their era. But this course also seeks to look at the role of hearing women in deaf history. Hearing
women dominated the field of deaf education in the late nineteenth century. They had a tremendous impact on the lives of deaf children and the events of deaf educational history. Hearing
women were also important figures in deaf history as mothers. As mothers of deaf children,
hearing women were frequently asked to behave as teachers in the home. Their embrace of this
role often led them to endorse oral education, and oppose the sign language. Hearing mothers in this way were pitted against their adult deaf daughters, who frequently went on to learn
sign language against their mothers’ wishes. The historically complex relationship between
women and the deaf community will be explored in this course. Class 3, Credit 3 (biannually)

Environmental Disasters
This class will survey the history environmental disasters (from floods to oil spills) in modern American and global society. Students will study several specific disasters (for example,
Hurricane Katrina, the Great Midwestern Floods of the 1990s, Love Canal, and the Haitian
Earthquake of 2008) and analyze a series of broader themes that illuminate their meaning,
including the economic impact of various disasters, the legal and political ramifications of
modern disasters, and the social and cultural meaning of disasters in various societies. Class

Conflict in Modern East Asia
The 20th century has sometimes been called the Pacific Century. The 20th century saw the rise
of four great Pacific powers; the U.S., Japan, China, and the Soviet Union, and saw the eclipse
of several others, including the British and French Empires. Furthermore a major front of the
Cold War was played out on the Asian continent, namely the Korean and Vietnam wars, as
well as the U.S. standoff with Communist China. And of course World War II, the greatest
concentrated period of human destruction, played out at the midpoint of the 20th century.
This class will analyze these conflicts both as conflicts in and of themselves, but will also look
at the backdrop against which these conflicts were played out. Beginning with the subjugation
of China in the 19th century, our class will examine the many conflicts that defined this region
through the end of the 20th century. Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)

Histories of Christianity
The history of Christianity is not simply the history of the religion of the West. Rather, Christian
history is a long and complex movement that has profoundly affected Asia, Africa, Europe, and
the New World. At various times there were several competing ideologies of Christianity, of
which the west’s was only a single example. Christianity also has a long history of interacting
with other religions, from Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism to Judaism and Islam. This course
will trace the development of Christianity paying special attention to how the Christian tradition developed in places such as Africa and Asia. We will, of course, also study Christianity in
its western forms, but we will make an effort to dive into the rich tradition of this religion in
all its many forms. Class 3, Credit 3 (annually)

International Business History
This course provides an overview on the history of international business since the late 19th
century. We will examine social change over time in how corporations have handled expansion into foreign markets, why corporations decided to, or not to, expand abroad, how they
managed their foreign operations, and what contributed to their success or failure abroad.
To do so, we will look at a variety of factors including how corporations dealt with corporate
communication, local regulations, transfers of knowledge and technology, and how corporate
decisions affect communities. We will apply these historical insights to case studies of multinational corporations. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

Technology in the Modern World
Trains, planes, automobiles, phones, and computers — modern technologies like these make
our daily lives pleasant and convenient. Yet, many people around the globe lack access to these
technologies. In this course, we will investigate the emergence of industrial manufacturing processes in late 18th century Britain that allowed for the development of these technologies. We
will also examine how new technologies spread to other places in the world, how they shaped
colonial relations, and what role they play in today’s developing world. In this course, you will
gain a better understanding of how people around the world have shaped their technologies,
and how technologies in turn have shaped them. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

Biography As History
This course will look at biography as a form of history. By studying biographies that approach
their subjects with various formats and methods of presentation, the class will examine how
the craft of biography shapes our contemporary understanding of the historical past. Among
the questions to be examined in this course are: how does biography reveal the historical circumstances of the subject’s life to give readers a broader understanding of the historical context
of that life? How effectively can contemporary readers explore the past through the prism of
one person’s life? Can the history of an era be effectively told through an examination of one
person’s life? What are the benefits of the biographical approach to history? What are the drawbacks? What are the benefits of biography as a form of public history? That is, when people
can get their history through the Biography Channel, how important is it for public historians
to grapple with the impact of biography as a form with a unique grip on the public imagination? Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

East-West Encounters
The Age of Discovery, beginning in the 15th century and culminating with the advent of
European imperialism, is one of the most fascinating, as well as problematic, periods in the
history of both Asia and Europe. Too often historians frame the interaction between Asia and
Europe in uniquely European terms and present Asia as a passive partner in this process of
discovery. In fact, this period presents us with a number of complex issues such as national
identity, the nature of European expansion, and the Asian response to European journeys to the
East. This course will undertake to re-examine the age of discovery not only from a European
point of view, but also from an Asian standpoint. In the process, we will see how many of the
issues that we are facing in the region are products of a long and complex relationship between
Europe and Asia. Students will also examine the issues that have arisen between the east and
the west in the 20th century and that continue into our own time. Class 3, Credit 3 (F, S)

Samurai in Word and Image
One of the most enduring images of premodern Japan in the samurai, replete with sword and

popular perceptions in Japanese film, woodblock prints, and texts. We will also use a variety
of secondary sources to critically examine some of the portrayals of the samurai and how they
stand up to historical reality. Students will be encouraged to participate in extensive discussions as we deal with a great variety of media and try to arrive at an image of the samurai that
is historically accurate. And finally, we will examine issues such as feudalism and the warrior
code and how those historical concepts relate to the west at about the same time period. Class

Science, Tech, and European Imperialism: 1800-1965
Between 1800 and 1945, Western nations dominated approximately three-quarters of the
earth’s surface through imperialism. This course examines how industrialization, technological developments, and the emergence of the modern sciences facilitated Europe’s conquest and
colonization of vast territories overseas. The course opens with a brief overview of the role of
biology and science in shaping early imperial encounters (the Columbian Exchange). Students
will then consider how 19th-century botany, zoology, acclimatization, cartography, geography, and anthropology became imperial sciences that facilitated formal conquest by producing
knowledge about distant cultures, races, and environments. The Industrial Revolution produced
new technological tools--steamboats, railroads, and weapons--that facilitated the scramble for
territory in the late 19th century. The course will consider how these inventions shaped patterns of conquest and colonial rule in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Throughout the
course, students will interrogate how Europeans’ faith in the superiority of Western technology,
scientific knowledge, and medicine shaped the evolution of the European civilizing mission-the cultural and political logic that defined interactions between Europeans and non-Western
populations. At the same time, they will evaluate how Africans and Asians experienced living
under colonial rule, and in some cases, how they deployed Western technology as weapons of
resistance to imperialism. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

Global Information Age
The internet and cell phones seem to have turned us into world citizens of cyberspace.
Programmers in Bangalore or Chennay now write software for U.S. companies, and doctors
in India or Australia interpret the CT-Scan or MRI images of U.S. patients overnight. As bestselling author Thomas Friedman argues, “the world is flat,” that is competition for intellectual work
is now global. Others have suggested that information technologies have led to global homogenization, with people around the world reading the same news, listening to the same music,
and purchasing the same products. In this class, we will investigate the history of information
and communication technologies to cast new light on these claims about our present-day technologies. This class is a small seminar which includes a research project. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

International and Global Studies
INGS-101 
Global Studies
Within the past three decades, planetary computerization, burgeoning media industries, and
other global processes have significantly altered the ways in which we experience our local and
global worlds. Global reconfigurations of time and space change our consciousness, sense of
self and others, and the material realities in which we live and work. This course provides the
conceptual tools to assess emerging global processes, interactions and flows of people, ideas
and things that challenge historical patterns of international studies and relations. The course
will introduce you to international and global processes in areas such as global cultural economies, global cities, new forms of democracy and civil society, global religions, sexualities,
health, and environments, increased competition for resources, political conflict, war and terrorism. Beyond understanding the causes and consequences of global change, this course will
introduce you to ethical dilemmas in global justice movements, and in transferring ideas and
technologies in new global contexts. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)

Histories of Globalization
This course examines narratives of globalization as human process. We will focus on contemporary and historical issues that are routinely conceived of as affecting or pertaining to the world’s
population in its entirety, such as human rights, humanitarianism, environmental degradation,
trade, and military power. The world and its population will feature as a unit of analysis, and
an emphasis will be placed on issues that appear to be in tension with the role of the nationstate and nationality, and highlight world and global citizenship. We will explore critiques of
the conceptualization of globality and worldliness as a factor in determining social, cultural,
and historical change. Cross-listed with INGS 201. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

Introduction to Africa and the Diaspora
This course is an introduction to the study of an enormous continent, Africa and its Diaspora.
Because of the dimensions of the geography, population and time covered, one of the main purposes of this course is to pave the way to narrower regional or thematic classes. This course will
emphasize the interdisciplinarity of African and Diaspora studies. We will explore contrasting
and complementing disciplinary perspectives on Africa and its Diaspora. We will move our
way through African and Diasporic cultures and histories both temporally and thematically.
Lectures will introduce key themes and ideas, and you will discuss textual and visual evidence
for African and Diasporic communities, cultures and ideas. This course is suitable to those new
to the study of Africa and its Diaspora, and to those who are considering taking further classes
or seminars in African and/or Diasporic studies. Part of the international and global studies

Cuisine, Culture and Power
Physically, culturally, and socially, humans live through food and drink. Spanning the globe, as
nearly limitless omnivores, humans have developed myriad ways of collecting and cultivating
food and taking advantage of local environments. We also put food to work for us socially by
creating cuisine. Through cuisine, we forge and nourish relationships, commune with deities,
and through luxury choices, demonstrate our taste and lay claim to elite status. Through the
cultural practices of production and consumption of food and drink, we wield power. Food and
drink consumption patterns have sustained slavery, poverty, malnutrition, and illegal immigration, and have laid waste to the environment. In this class, we explore physical, cultural,
social, political, and economic dimensions of food and become more aware of how the private,
intimate act of a bite connects us to the rest of humanity. Counts toward the international and
global studies major (sustainable futures track); sociology and anthropology major (cultural
anthropology track); sociology and anthropology minor; cultural anthropology immersion.

Global Slavery and Human Trafficking
This course examines historical and contemporary dimensions of global slavery and human
trafficking. The trans-Atlantic slave trade was the world’s largest forced migration between
continents, but it was only one of many slave trades that shaped societies throughout the
world. In order to understand the historical significance of global slave trades, we will compare it to other systems of slavery. In examining the historical significance and legacies of the
slave trade, we will link different regional histories to the growth of market-based capitalist
economies into the twentieth century. The course will also examine the changing meaning of
the term ‘slavery’ and examine some modern forms of forced labor, bondage, and slavery that
persist to this day in all sectors of the global economy. We will explore the rise of human trafficking, and global anti-trafficking programs and campaigns. Part of the international studies

Museum Studies
MUSE-220 
Introduction to Museums and Collecting
This course examines the history, theory, ideology, and practice of collecting within the institutional context of the museum. It considers the formation of the modern museum, and focusing
on the American context, investigates the function and varieties of museums, ranging from
natural history, anthropology, science and technology, history, and art. The course explores the
history of the museum and its evolution institutionally, ideologically, and experientially. The
course also considers the operations of museums from accessioning through deaccessioning,
examining museum management, collections management and collections care. The course
also explores museum governance and the professional ethics and legal constraints that affect
museum professionals. The course examines how a museum carries out its mission of public
education through its collections and exhibitions, as well as through its educational programs
and community outreach and visitor studies. Current issues in the museum world are also considered, including: the museum’s educational function versus its entertainment function; the
problems of staying solvent in an era of diminishing governmental and corporate subsidies;
deaccessioning collections to support the museum operations; issues of art theft and repatriation (ranging from colonial era and Nazi era plunder, the disposition of human remains and
sacred objects, and illicit trafficking); the evolving responsibilities of the museum to its public
and the cultural heritage; and the rise of the virtual museum. Throughout the semester, the
course examines museums and their practices through the perspectives of colonialism, nationalism, class, race, age, gender, and ethnicity. The course includes field trips to local museums
and collections throughout the semester. (Co-requisite: ARTH-135 Survey of Western Art and

Introduction to Public History
Public history is using the research-based methods and techniques of historians to conduct
historical work in the public sphere. If you've gone to a museum, conducted an oral history,
researched your old house, or learned from an interpreter at a park or historic site, you've seen
public history in action. This course will introduce students to the wide variety of careers in
public history, and will examine the challenges and opportunities that come with doing history in, with, and for the public. Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

History and Theory of Exhibitions
Art exhibitions are organized around a curatorial premise, a statement that articulates an idea
allowing for the selection of work included in an exhibition. This course begins with an overview of exhibition history, starting with the transformation of the Louvre into the first public
art museum following the French Revolution, where art history, a discipline developed in the
19th century, was enlisted to organize exhibition. The course then examines the proliferation
of types of exhibitions that accompanies modernism, up to the present, paying close attention
to the curatorial premise animating the exhibitions. (MUSE-220 Introduction to Museums &
Collecting) Class 3, Credit 3 (S)

Fundraising, Grant Writing, and Marketing for Nonprofit Institutions
This course examines the growing autonomy of collecting institutions as they are cut off from
various forms of governmental sponsorship and public subsidy and their subsequent needs
for raising money from outside, non-traditional sources. The course looks at issues of needs
assessment, budgeting, and strategic planning. It focuses on the design and implementation
of effective fundraising campaigns, as well as on the organization and writing of successful
grant proposals. It also considers the importance of marketing to overall institutional success.

MUSE-358 
Legal and Ethical Issues for Collecting Institutions
This course presents an overview of the legal and ethical issues that govern the institutions
and personnel involved in collecting cultural resources. Collecting institutions are governed
by national, state, and local laws that define how facilities and collections are used and this
course will consider them, as well as the larger social and historical context out of which they
developed. The course will consider the evolution of the museum as a public institution and
how the legal system increasingly defined minimum standards for maintaining collections,
the facilities in which they are housed, and guaranteeing public access; in addition legal standards for the collection will be studied, including definitions of ownership, what this means in
terms of intellectual property rights, copyright, reproduction (traditional and electronic), and
deaccessioning/disposal. These will be studied within the context of the society within which
the institution functions. The course will also study the development of national and international ethical standards and will examine the codes of behavior that govern the personal
and professional conduct of museum professionals and the practices that comprise conflicts
of interest. Ethical standards for collecting institutions will also be considered, particularly
those that address the responsibilities to a collection, the ethics of acquisition, the question of
illicit or stolen material, the issues of human remains and objects of sacred significance, and
repatriation. Attention will be paid to the changes in society that made these issues critical for
collecting institutions. Class 3, Credit 3 (F)

related to morality? What are the grounds for moral obligations? Is there an ultimate moral
principle? How do we reason about what to do? Can reason determine how we ought to live?
What are moral judgments? Are there universal goods? What constitutes a morally worthwhile
life? Can morality itself be challenged? Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)
PHIL-203 
Modern Philosophy
This course examines the history of modern philosophy, from Descartes through Kant. It concentrates on the development of modern thought, examining the concepts of mind, body, and
causation among others. This period marked the beginning of modern science, with a rich ferment of ideas, and the philosophy of the period is essential to understanding modern science
as well as contemporary problems about consciousness, mind/body interaction, causation, and
so on. Questions to be considered in this course include the following: What can we know?
How do we come to know what we can know? What is the scope and what are the limits of our
knowledge? What is the nature of reality? Do we have access to reality? How is causal interaction possible, if at all? Does God exist, and if so, how do we know and what relation does God

Philosophy of Technology
Technology is a ubiquitous and defining force in our world. This course investigates how our
conceptions of technology have emerged within philosophy, as well as the role technology
plays in shaping how we live and how we reflect upon questions of meaning and value in life.
Technological modes of understanding, organizing and transforming the world shape our relationships with others, with ourselves and with nature at fundamental levels. We will explore
how these modes have emerged and why they emerged so predominantly within a Western
social and intellectual context. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)
PHIL-308 
Environmental Philosophy
A variety of decision procedures may be and have been used to determine what to do regarding
various environmental issues. We might make the choice that has the least worst alternatives,
or the best alternatives, or is approved by the majority of those who vote or of those who are
affected, etc. Each alternative can determine what is reasonable and moral, and assessing them
presents theoretical problems. We examine each in terms of morality, examine their presuppositions and consequences, determine whether we can assess them, and if so, how. Students begin
to learn to be conscious of and assess the decision procedures that are often buried in policy
recommendations regarding particular environmental problems. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)
PHIL-309 
Feminist Theory
This course examines the main currents in contemporary feminist thought. Feminist theory
explores the nature and effects of categories of sex and gender upon our ways of living, thinking
and doing, while also challenging how gendered assumptions might shape our conceptions of
identity and inquiry more generally. Different conceptions of sex and gender will be discussed,
and the course will investigate how these concepts affect our lives in both concrete and symbolic
ways. Special attention will be paid to how gendered assumptions color our understanding of
knowledge production, experiences of embodiment and emotion, public and private activities,
and the nature of ethical decision making. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)
PHIL-310 
Theories of Knowledge
Epistemology, or the theory of knowledge, examines how we come to know what we know. This
course covers historical and contemporary approaches to the question of what knowledge is,
what makes a belief true, and how beliefs are justified. Philosophical skepticism, the idea that
we actually know nothing at all, will also be discussed, as well as possible responses. Other topics
may include epistemic relativism, feminist epistemology, naturalism, the internalism/externalism debate, and the application of epistemology to other fields. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

American Philosophy
This course examines the contributions of American philosophers from the colonial era to the
present day. From the New England Transcendentalists of the 19th century, to the Pragmatism
and Neo-Pragmatism of the 20th and 21st, American philosophy has responded to the demands
of a pluralistic, ever-changing society. Because American philosophy is a reflection of American
culture, it has also offered a unique perspective on perennial philosophical problems in ways
that have differed sharply from dominant forms of European philosophy. Authors may include
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, C.S.
Peirce, Jane Addams, William James, John Dewey, Richard Rorty, and Cornel West. (One philosophy course strongly recommended) Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

well as the similarities and differences between the social and natural sciences. Special attention
will be paid to the ways in which both Anglo-American and European philosophical traditions
approach the social sciences. Other topics may include the role of values in social scientific
inquiry, the processes of explanation and theory confirmation in the social sciences, and various
conceptions of interpretation and meaning in the social sciences. The course will also examine
how the tensions between claims of universality and claims of relativism, claims of objectivity

Sociology
SOCI-102 
Foundations of Sociology
Sociology is the study of the social world and socialization processes. Sociologists study the
broader picture of how societies are structured and organized through a macro-sociological
analysis as well as how individuals create their own social reality symbolically through their
interactions with others in a micro-sociological analysis. Students in this course will learn the
fundamentals of each approach and come away with a sociological framework which they can
critically apply to their own lives. Required for the sociology track of the sociology and anthropology major. Class 3, Credit 3 (F, S)
SOCI-102H 
Honors Sociology
This course explores how sociological concepts, theories and research account for such social
phenomena as socialization, deviance, social structure, stratification, political and religious
affiliation and social change. It will also explore how social factors account for political and
economic behavior and the speed and spread of technological change. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)
SOCI-103 
Urban Experience
Cities have an important effect on social interaction. Through their design, they bring together
diverse groups of people, in unique spatial settings which can create and maintain opportunities for either interaction or segregation. This course examines theories explaining urban
life, the development and growth of cities, their role in shaping human interaction, and the
problems that emerge within and surrounding them. Topics covered include education, immigration, residential segregation, poverty, homelessness, crime, sprawl, sustainable development
and urban planning. Counts toward sociology and anthropology major (urban studies track).

SOCI-201 
Writing About Society and Culture
This course explores the politics and poetics of writing about society and culture. Writing is a
form of power, in that our representations of people influence the way that others think about
and act toward them. The way that social researchers write is therefore shot through with
ethical implications and weighty decisions. Critical issues include whether people are objectified, cast as wholly Other, culture-bound or creative, out of the past or coeval, racialized or of
a common humanity, problematic or multifaceted, passive or agentive, mystified or perceptive, and mechanical or extraordinary. Writing about society and culture is also poetic. We can
convey something of people’s life experiences, thoughts, agency, and the constraints within
which they lead their lives. How well we do so depends upon our ethical reflexivity and attention to the poetics of language. In this course, we will consider these ethical questions, read
experimental texts, and discuss how writing style implicitly conveys social theory. Required
for Soc-Anth degree; counts toward Soc-Anth minor. Cross-listed with SOCI-201. (Any one of
the following: ANTH-102, ANTH-102H, ANTH-103, INGS-101, SOCI-102, SOCI-102H, SOCI103, or equivalent). Class 3, Credit 3 (F)

The Changing Family
This course examines the essential concepts and theories fundamental to the social science of
family studies. It analyzes family systems with reference to gender role, participation in the
workplace, marital relationships and communication between parents and children. The course
also focuses on ways in which changes in the economy and technology have influenced the form
of the family, and men’s and women’s work. Counts toward the sociology and anthropology
major (sociology track). Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)
SOCI-220 
Minority Group Relations
The course will provide a context in which to examine the multiple and contradictory social
relations of domination, subordination, resistance, and empowerment. The kinds of questions we will explore focus on how power, knowledge, meaning, and cultural representation
are organized. We will analyze a variety of political and ideological themes which bear upon
the formation of minority group relations, their identity and how these themes complicate the
processes by which people construct their understanding of the nation, world, of others, and
themselves. Through reflection on theoretical texts and fictional works, as well as film and
other popular media, we will consider for ourselves how culture is differently represented and
signified, and how the politics of understanding and misunderstanding minority relations
work through practices within and outside cultural institutions. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)
SOCI-225 
Social Inequality
This course examines various forms of social inequality, including economic, political, health,
higher education, race and sex inequality. It uses a variety of sociology’s ideas to explain why
these kinds of inequality exist, how they persist and what can be done about them. Required
for sociology and anthropology majors in the sociology Track. Class, 3 Credit, 3 (S)
SOCI-230 
Sociology of Work
This course analyzes and assesses social relations of paid labor. Sociology’s major ideas about
the ways we work will be examined and applied to numerous important topics such as: workplace organization, unions, labor legislation, health and safety, workplace culture, interplays
between work and family, experiences of work as alienating or satisfying, inequalities at work,
and social mobility. Counts toward sociology and snthropology major (sociology track). Class
3, Credit 3 (F)
SOCI-235 
Women, Work, and Culture
In this course, we analyze historical and contemporary patterns of gender, race/ethnicity, sexuality, and the organization of work. Using the theoretical perspectives we analyze the work
historically undertaken by women in societies and its relationship to broader political and economic structures. While our primary focus is on the U.S., we will also conduct a cross-cultural
analysis of gender and work in developing and industrializing societies. Specific issues include
gender discrimination (e.g., wage discrimination, sexual harassment), sexuality, reproduction,
and women organizing to control their work and working conditions. Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

SOCI-250 
Globalization and Security
This course focuses on the shifting relationships between globalization and security. The
emphasis is on security matters that arise with view to effective population management
and control over the circulation of people, goods, capital, crime, diseases, and resources. The
analytic framework uses the concept of governmentality to examine the management of populations and their welfare on a global scale. Under globalization, people and populations can
be managed through security measures that are implemented to address specific cross-border
problems, such as immigration and labor migration, terrorism, the flow of drugs, epidemics,
human trafficking and control of natural resources. The course examines these security issues
in a globalizing world. Counts toward the international and global studies major (globalization concentration; sustainable futures track; global justice, peace, and conflict studies track),
sociology and anthropology major (sociology track). (SOCI-102 or ANTH-102 or INGS-101
or equivalent). Class 3, Credit 3 (varies)

	

SOCI-255 Disaster! Assessing Vulnerabilities and Responses to Global States of Emergency
Disasters as global states of emergency result from complex relationships between human populations and environmental hazards. Disasters threaten sustainable development, especially
in the global south and among the world’s most vulnerable people. Global states of emergency
incur significant human and economic costs, which, in addition to increasing demographic,
environmental, socio-economic and related pressures, result in increasing population vulnerability. Explanations of the causes and consequences of disasters include examinations of how
human vulnerability is impacted by interactions among diverse social, economic, and other
factors with environmental hazards. We will discuss social vulnerability theories; sustainable
development theories; the causes and consequences of disasters and interventions to manage
and reduce these risks. Counts toward the international and global studies major (sustainable futures track), sociology and anthropology major (sociology track). Class 3, Credit 3

regarding human behavior, the organization of society, the nature of culture, the relationship
between the individual and society, social control and social conflict, social groups and social
hierarchy, the operation of power, cultural and social change, and the interplay between the
global and the local. Theories will be marshaled to shed light on contemporary social and cultural phenomena and problems such as crime, violence, exploitation, modernity, and globalization.

Quantitative Research
The research conducted by sociologists and anthropologists generates large, complex data sets
that are difficult to interpret subjectively. Multivariate quantitative methods are an important
tool for understanding these data. This course presents an introduction to quantitative research
in sociology and anthropology: how to craft a research question and research design that utilize
quantitative data, how to select appropriate quantitative techniques and apply them, how to
present results, and how to critically evaluate quantitatively based knowledge claims. Topics
include: research design, collecting and cod-ing data, non-metric data, data screening, exploratory data analysis, selection and use of appropriate analysis techniques, comparing groups,
exploration of variance, classification, and modeling. The course features laboratory exercises
and a final project in which the student selects a research problem and data set, which they analyze and present to the class. Counts toward the sociology and anthropology major; sociology

U.S. Housing Policy
Housing is a critical component in assuring basic survival. Through the design, sale, and development of housing in the United States, many Americans’ lives are shaped by their residence.
In response, this course examines the role of American housing policy in its relationship to
other social issues, including racial segregation, endemic poverty, educational and economic
inequality, sprawl and traffic, and environmental degradation. Special emphasis will be paid
to explain how current housing policy both creates and eliminates housing options and their
related social issues. (SOCI-103 Urban Experience or SOCI-102 Foundations of Sociology)

Global Exiles of War and Terror
Daily we watch, seemingly helplessly, as people are displaced from their communities, homelands, and countries and subsequently seek asylum around the world, sometimes within our
own local communities. Causes of displacement include war, violence, persecution, and modes
of terror that increasingly affect the lives of women and children. In addition to the loss of
human life and potential, the ensuing consequences of violent displacement include poverty,
disease, physical and psychological trauma, hopelessness, and vulnerability to human rights
abuses. In this course, we explore how the rights and dignity of refugees can be protected. We
also examine resettlement processes and, for those who are eventually repatriated, we address
how they can successfully reintegrate into reconstructing societies that remain barely functional. Most importantly, we consider how the trauma of displacement can be minimized.

employees function together and like working in the place they do. Ultimately organizational
effectiveness and success depends on a healthy organizational culture. This course introduces
organizational culture and methods of analyzing it. The course takes an interdisciplinary functionalist view of organizational culture and subcultures as being: (a) things observed, felt, heard
and expressed by employees; (b) organizational values espoused in mission statements, goals,
ideals, norms, standards, and moral principles; and (c) underlying assumptions of employees
about their roles, responsibilities and relationships given available resources relative to client/
constituency performance expectations, applicable labor-management agreements and regulatory/safety compliance issues. Methods for analyzing the health of organizational culture and
subcultures are related to various kinds of circumstances faced by firms, organizations and
agencies. (Third year standing or permission of instructor.) Class 3, Credit 3 (F).

Managing Organizational Change
Sooner or later all organizations change in certain to many respects and for several reasons.
This is true for organizations in profit, non-profit and government sectors which all have many
things common. Ongoing organizational success frequently depends on how well change is
managed given new opportunities, challenges or threats faced by organizations. Managing
organizational change requires knowledge of things in an organization that may need to be
changed including an organization’s mission, goals, fiscal health, budget, operations and/or
production/service capabilities, facilities, unit structure, personnel, culture, technology and
other resources. Effective management of organizational change also requires knowledge of and
skills in ways to introduce, guide, support, monitor and evaluate changes once they are implemented. This course takes an interdisciplinary applied approach to managing organizational
change teaching SOAR-based strategic planning, SWOT analysis, total quality management
(TQM) and continuous quality improvement (CQI) among other change models and methods.

Tango Dancing will focus on dancing comfortably and expressively to traditional tango music
in a social setting. Argentine Tango traditionally stresses improvisation over repetition of set
patterns. Students will progress from simple walking exercises to an introduction to simple
steps and figures that are idiomatic of Argentine tango. Once students are comfortable with
basic figures and a connection to the music and their partner, we will progress to more complex sequences built up from the basics. We will emphasize the spontaneous discovery of these
sequences as a creative response in the moment to the music and to our partners over the route
memorization of rigid choreography. Students will learn the art of dancing expressively while
also respecting the boundaries of other dancers on the floor. Navigation—or floor craft—is
an essential skill to master in order to enjoy dancing in a crowded room. Upon completion of

Meeting, just 2 weeks of high-intensity intervals improves your aerobic capacity as much as 6
to 8 weeks endurance training. Because the intervals are short, you will be working hard the
whole time. The trade-off is this format offers seasoned exercisers a new challenge and new
exercisers a quick way to see results. **A $90 course fee applies via SFS bill (F, S); $60.00 course
