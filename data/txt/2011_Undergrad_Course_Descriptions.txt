Survey of Western Art and Architecture I, II, III
A sequential series of courses focusing on the history of Western art and architecture, from Prehistoric times to circa 1950. We will examine the form, style,
function and meaning of important monuments of the past, and consider
these in their historical and cultural context. We will approach these objects
in chronological order, for students first need to learn when, where and by
whom (whether a people, or a known individual) a given object was produced
before they can attempt to determine why the object was made, what it meant
in its time and place (as opposed to what it may mean to us today), and whose
ideology it served. Once we know how to classify visual information, we may
be able to make historical sense of the surviving evidence. Credit 3

Art and Activism
This course will focus on artists using their work for the purpose of changing society. Students will consider work by both individual artists and artists
working in groups that cause critics, art historians, other artists and the viewing public to ask if what they are doing is art. Although there will be forays
back to the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the time will be dedicated to
artists of the last three decades. We will examine texts that propose art to be a
form of activism and persuade artists to be responsible for the way they represent the world and maybe even determine if the goal of art is not to represent
it in the first place. The artists we discuss are concerned with problems in our
society that affect gender, race, sexuality, poverty, labor issues, and the environment. (2039-225, 2039-226, 2039-227) Credit 3

Traumatic Images
This course investigates visual culture and its imagistic response to life’s crises. Problems of identity and identification will be explored and confronted
through works of photography, painting, mixed media, new media and film of
the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. Beginning with the late 19th century vogue
for images of “hysterical” women, crippled “black-sheep” family members
and dead loved ones (as corpses and as ghosts), we then move on to consider
the last century’s fascination with pain and suffering, disease and violence,
struggle and survival and then the 21st century’s emphasis on terrorism.
Specifically, we will focus on the gendering of images and imaging as disturbing pictures work to defy the formal and theoretical distinction between
private and public, personal and collective experience and manage the often
conflicting responsibilities to self, family, religion, race, nation and society.

into the most intelligent and capable beings on the planet? Is it possible for
“life” and “mind” to emerge out of a wholly material evolutionary process?
This course will address these issues drawing from resources in the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of technology. Part of the philosophy degree
program, the philosophy concentration and minor and may also be taken as
an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)

Technology and Embodiment
This course investigates how technological practices and inventions can
suggest new ideas for conceptualizing how the body works, what the body
is fundamentally, and what the body can (as well as should) become. By
critically examining different conceptions of embodiment as well as different
technologies that mediate our embodied relation to the world, we will enrich
our understanding of the nature and scope of agency and identity. Part of the
philosophy degree program, the philosophy concentration and minor and
may also be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)

Philosophy of Language
This course examines how philosophers and others have understood the
nature of language. It explores the classical philosophical contexts in metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics and rhetoric in which concerns about the nature of
language arose. In addition, the course focuses on recent debates, within both
contemporary analytic and continental traditions of philosophy. Some likely
areas of inquiry will be: theories of reference, description and naming; theories
of meaning, metaphor and narrative; functionalist, pragmatist and naturalist
accounts; structuralism, post-structuralism, and hermeneutic accounts, among
others. Part of the philosophy degree program, the philosophy concentration
and minor and may also be taken as an elective. (At least one prior course in
philosophy is strongly recommended) Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)

Philosophy of Vision and Imaging
This course examines how philosophers and others have understood the
nature and primacy of sight. It explores how technologies of seeing and imaging have influenced theories of sight and our most dominant and authoritative
practices of seeing and representing in the humanities and the arts, as well as
in the natural and social sciences. The course will focus on the impact these
theories and practices of seeing and representing—both analogue and digital—
have on the nature of knowing, as well as on how they shape and mediate our
experiences of personal and social identity and agency more generally. Part of
the philosophy degree program, the philosophy concentration and minor, the
religious studies concentration and may also be taken as an elective. (At least
one prior course in philosophy is strongly recommended) Class 4, Credit 4

Cultural Anthropology
This course explores how human beings across the globe live and work
according to different values and beliefs. Students will develop the tools for
acquiring knowledge, awareness, and appreciation of cultural differences,
and in turn enhance their abilities to interact across cultures. The course
accomplishes these aims by examining the relationship between individuals
and their communities, and the dynamics of ritual, religious, political, and
social life in different parts of the world. Fulfills a liberal arts core social science requirement. Counts as a prerequisite for the sociology/anthropology
concentration and minor and the international studies and urban community
studies majors as a prerequisite for cultures in globalization. Class 4, Credit 4
(offered quarterly)

AE: Ritual and Performance
The world’s cultural diversity is most vividly and dynamically displayed
through ritual, performance, and festival. Ritual is found in all cultures,
indicating that it serves universal human needs. Through examination of performances in different cultures, this course explores the roles of ritual in the
lives of individuals and the structure of society. Topics include the origins of
ritual, ritual symbols, ritual and childhood socialization, ritual and emotions,
initiation into adulthood, ritual as social glue, the role of ritual in reinforcing
hierarchy, and the potential for social transformation. Films supplement class
readings and discussion. Written expression is enhanced through drafting,
revision, and peer review. Counts toward the arts of expression requirement
or may be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

0510-325	
Honors: Cultural Anthropology
Cultural anthropology is the study of cultural diversity and cultural change.
Anthropologists use techniques of immersion to gain a close, insider’s view
of a culture. Anthropological research addresses some of the most prominent
and pressing social issues of our time, including international migration, mass
media, changing views of gender and sexuality, racism, tourism, religious fundamentalism, ethnic nationalism, war and genocide, hunger and famine, and
the globalization of popular culture. This course introduces cultural anthropology and each year it may focus on a different topic. Fulfills a liberal arts core
social science requirement. Counts as a prerequisite for the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)
0510-440	
Cultures in Globalization
Change in all subsystems of human culture is the norm on the planet earth as
its human inhabitants begin the 21st century and a new millennium. In particular, the stress and strain that accompany change challenge traditional life
ways among both indigenous and peasant societies in the developing world.
The change is driven by many factors including global and local population
growth and by the expanding world capitalist system through which technology is transferred and the culture of consumption is spread to the most remote
corners of the globe. Required course for international studies majors. Part of
the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor, the globalization concentration, and may also be taken as an elective. (0510-210, 0515-210 or equivalent) Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

Cultures and Politics in Latin America
This course introduces cultures of Latin America and the Spanish-speaking
Caribbean in the context of political and economic forces that have shaped
them. We examine Spanish and Portuguese colonialism and its modern-day
legacies, including ethnic inequalities, economic vulnerability, and social
unrest. We examine how art, music and literature have engaged critically with
the forces of fascism, revolution, socialism, dictatorship, and neo-imperialism.
We review religious diversity (from Santeriia to Pentecostalism); dynamic
relationships between countryside and city; and changing roles of men and
women. Part of Latino/Latina American concentration, sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; Native American science and technology concentration; Spanish language/culture concentration and minor; and may also

Immigration to the United States
This course examines immigration to the U.S. within the context of globalization. We examine the push and pull-factors that generate immigration, and
changing immigration policies and debates. We consider how changes in the
American workplace have stimulated the demand for foreign workers in a
wide range of occupations from software engineer to migrant farmworker and
nanny. We review the cultural and emotional challenges of adapting within
the American cultural landscape; transnationalism and connections with the
homeland; the experiences of refugees; and how immigration has changed
since 9/11. Part of the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; the
urban studies concentration and minor, the globalization concentration; and

The Global Economy and the Grassroots
Economic globalization has given birth to global, grassroots social movements. This course examines how global economic integration is brought about
through multilateral institutions, multinational corporations, outsourcing, trade
agreements, international lending, and neoliberal reforms. We consider impacts
(cultural, economic, and health) of these trends on employees, farmers, small
businesses, consumers, and the environment in the developed and developing
worlds. We examine beliefs, alternative visions, and strategies of grassroots
movements in response to these challenges. Part of the Latino/Latina/Latin
American concentration; sociology/anthropology concentration and minor;
Spanish language/culture concentration and minor; the globalization concentration; and may also be taken as an elective. Part of the international studies

Global Cities
This course examines the impact of global dynamics on cities from the early
twentieth century to the present. By tracing urban formations from metropolis
to global city, emphasis will be placed on the making of identities, communities,
and citizens in the architectural spaces, cultural places, ethnic zones, and media
traces of urban life in the context of globalization. This is a required core course
for the urban and community studies program and part of the major in international studies program in a related track. Part of the sociology/anthropology
concentration and minor; the globalization concentration; and may also be taken
as an elective. (0510-210, 0515-210 or equivalent) Restricted to students in their
second-year and above. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)
0510-446	
Native North Americans
The resilience of Native North Americans continues to amaze anthropologists
and those who once proclaimed them certain for extinction. What can now be
acclaimed as a remarkable revival of dead Indians, these cultures are rich and
thriving. They maintain their world views but in a drastically changed and contemporary setting. Many tribes own casinos, hotels, resorts, and other successful
businesses. Not only are the values and their heritage alive and well, they are
quite successful in reviving the formerly outlawed traditions of the past such as
potlatch, medicine lodge, and ghost dance. This course is taught from a Native
American perspective and addresses both past and current issues that affect
their culture, heritage, and tribal sovereignty. Part of the major in international
studies in a related track; the Native American science and technology concentration; the religious studies concentration; the material cultural studies concentration; and the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor. May also be
taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)
0510-447	
Anthropology of Mass Media
This course examines the cultural importance of mass media in different
societies. By analyzing the flow of media images across national borders,
emphasis is given to the local impact of media culture in different parts of the
world. How, for example, do mass media represent and shape the cultural
values and beliefs in developing societies? What is the role of mass media in
forging national and ethnic identities, body images, sexuality and gender, and
the experience of war and violence in western and non-western societies? Part
of the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor, and the globalization
concentration. May also be taken as an elective. (0510-210, 0515-210 or equivalent) Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)
0510-448	
Native North Americans in Film
From visions of romantic fantasy to imagery of the barbaric and horrific, Native
Americans have been misrepresented in film since the invention of motion pictures. Tonto, Pocahontas, Hiawatha, and how the west was won—how do you
know what is real and what is imagined? This course examines the genre of
Native American films and intends to critically analyze stereotypes, false imagery, and how these have infatuated even the most educated of viewers. While
anthropologists studied diligently among Native Americans, they too fed
Hollywood the embellished images that dominate the big screen. We will identify the roles anthropologists have played in the emergence and correction of
these Native American stereotypes. Part of the major in international studies in
a related track; the Native American science and technology concentration; and
the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor. May also be taken as an
elective. (0510-210, 0515-210 or equivalent) Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)
0510-449	
Sustainable Development
The international economic system (capitalist) has demonstrated extra ordinary
power in distributing goods to the farthest reaches of the globe. At the same
time there is an increase in inequality and in the numbers of poor and hungry,
often associated with environmental degradation. These changes are especially
obvious in cities, but not limited to them. Since 1987, building on the work of
the Brundtland Commission, there has been a concerted effort by the United
Nations, by non-governmental organizations, by individuals, and by some
nation states to explore paths of more sustainable development. This course
explores varied strategies now employed to achieve sustainable development,
with particular attention to less developed countries. Part of the major in international studies in a related track; the sociology/anthropology concentration
and minor; the globalization concentration; the environmental studies minor;

Cultural Resource Management Historical Preservation
This course will introduce students to the objectives of CRM and historic preservation, the methods of designing research in the CRM/ historic preservation
context that will make contributions to our knowledge of the past. We will
address the myriad considerations modern archaeologist and preservationists confront in their efforts to carry out archaeological research and historic
preservation within a complex legal and ethical framework Part of the major
in international studies in a related track, the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; and may be taken as an elective. (0510-210 or 0515-210 or

0510-451	
Global Sexualities
This course explores issues of gender and sexuality in a global context. Students
will be introduced to anthropological perspectives on the experience of men and
women, as gendered subjects, in different societies and historical contexts, such
as colonialism, nationalism, and global capitalism. In turn, we will explore how
cultural constructions of masculinity and femininity are configured by race, class,
ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Course materials are drawn from an array of
sources, reflecting various theoretical perspectives and ethnographic views from
different parts of the world. Part of the major in international studies (globalization core elective); the women’s and gender studies; the sociology/anthropology
concentration and minor; the globalization concentration; and may be taken as
an elective. (0524-210 or equivalent) Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)

Bodies and Culture
The body in culture, society, and history. Comparative approaches to the
cultural construction of bodies, and the impact of ethnic, gender, racial differences on body practices (i.e. surgical alteration, mutilation, beautification, surrogacy, erotica). The formation of normative discourses of the body (regarding
sexuality, AIDS/illness, reproduction, fat/food) in medical science, consumer
culture, and the mass media. The course will be discussion and project oriented, encouraging students to acquire a range of analytic skills through
a combination of text interpretation and research. Part of the sociology/
anthropology concentration and minor, the women’s and gender studies concentration and minor and may be taken as an elective. (0510-210 or 0515-210 or

Visual Anthropology
We see others as we imagine them to be, in terms of our values, not as they see
themselves. This course examines ways in which we can understand and represent the reality of others through visual media, across the boundaries of culture,
gender, and race. It considers how and why visual media can be used to represent or to distort the world around us. Part of the major in international studies
in a related track; the anthropology/sociology concentration and minor; and the
globalization concentration. May be taken as an elective. Restricted to secondyear students and above. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

Divided Europe
As Europe strives for political and economic unity, we see a concurrent push
toward inequality, exclusion, and marginalization: minorities, immigrants,
refugees, Blacks, Muslims, Jews, gypsies, and women struggle against discrimination. Not only the legacy of colonialism but the revitalization of nationalism
shape contemporary European cultural politics. Based on an anthropological
perspective, this course examines ways in which we can understand a divided
Europe through the intersections of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and religion.

Cultural Images of War and Terror
This course critically examines the optical regimes of war and terror in a global
world from an anthropological perspective. Representations of violence are endlessly transmitted on television, internet, print media, cinema, and recreational
games to become part of our everyday visual culture. Whether disseminated
as news, documentary truth, or entertainment, the ubiquitous encounters
with violence require a new form of visual literacy that not only highlights the
intersection of the local and the global, but also recognizes the ways in which
visual technologies, cultural politics of memory and history, media practices and
national ideologies intervene in the formation of a visual culture of war and terror. Part of the major in the international studies program; the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; the global justice/peace studies concentration;

0510-460	Genocide/Conflict/Justice
The destruction and survival of societies often hinges upon ideas of tribe, ethnicity, religion, nation, sovereignty and belonging. When ideas fail to incorporate people, essentialist categories of identity, historical memory, and accounts
of extreme violence become interrelated, potent sources of destruction. Slavery
and exclusive ownership of resources leave people starving or living in perilously polluted environments. We will take critical, anthropological approaches
to studies of genocide. Students will assess the destruction and survival of
societies, from the 19th century slaughter of Native Americans and Amazonian
Indians to more recent genocides in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, and the Sudan.

Native American Repatriation
NAR addresses issues surrounding cultural objects, contested ownerships,
repatriation, reparations, legal compliance, museum technologies and the everchanging role of repositories. This course facilitates experiential learning including work with the Rochester Museum and Science Center. Lectures, round-table
discussions, and instruction are provided by museum professionals, nationally
renowned speakers, and Native American representatives. Students will comprehend the breadth of federal legislation regulating human remains and objects
of culture patrimony, the complex legal and social issues facing museums and
communities, and the opportunities that exist as NAGPRA enters into its third
decade since ratification in 1990. Part of the International studies major; the
Native American science and technology concentration, the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; the archaeological science minor and may also
be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

Anthropology of Religion
Religious expression, from the spiritualism of voodoo to the monotheism
of Judaism and Islam, is the subject of this course. The course explores four
religious dimensions - sacred speech, sacred acts, sacred beings and sacred
places - through a broad cross-cultural samples including, among others,
contemporary Haiti; the Cibecue Apache and Hopi of Native North America;
Pygmy, San, and Azande of Africa; Bali in Indonesia; and Jewish and Islamic
fundamentalism in Southwest Asia. Religious practice is explored in holistic
cultural content. Insights into religious practice are developed from the point
of view of the practitioners and the outside observer looking in. Part of the
sociology/anthropology and the religious studies concentrations. May also be
taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)
0510-484	
Islamic Culture and the Middle East
This course focuses on introducing the fundamentals of the Middle East, with
an emphasis on Islam, to students with little or no prior background in the
region or the culture. The four themes to be addressed include: (1) foundations of Islam; (2) Islamic law and Islamic sects; (3) material and performance
culture in Islam; and (4) Islamic culture and the West. The rationale for this
course is to help students recognize and interpret fundamental concepts of
other cultures, to encourage students’ independent thinking about topical
events within their historical perspective, and to inspire students to examine
how their own cultures change and adapt to various students. Part of the
international studies major and the sociology/anthropology concentration.
May also be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)
0510-485	
Exploring Ancient Technology
While it is a common place to describe the present era as one dominated by
technology, humans have been critically dependent on technology for as
long as we have existed as a species. Some of today’s key technologies were
invented before the dawn of recorded history. We will explore these ancient
technologies, how they came to be invented, how they evolved, and how
they were integrated into the social and economic life of ancient and modern
peoples. Key concepts and themes will be explored in a series of hands-on labs
in which students will seek to replicate and understand a variety of ancient
technologies. The course concludes with either an individual project or a class
project. Part of the sociology/anthropology concentration, the material culture
studies concentration, the archaeology concentration and minor. May be taken
as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

0510-486	
African Cultural Histories
This course introduces students to the people and cultures of Africa through
the dynamism of African social life, economics, politics, religion, witchcraft,
science, arts, literature, aesthetics, sex, and gender to foster an awareness of
the diversity and complexity of African cultures, their geographies, and their
histories. Students will critically evaluate the legacies of slavery, early missionary activities and colonialism in contemporary struggles to define identity
and belonging, citizenship and access to resources in postcolonial Africa. Part
of the international studies major; the sociology/anthropology concentration
and minor, the African studies concentration; and may be taken as an elective.
Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)
0510-487	
African Popular Cultures
For many Africans, participating in popular cultures may be the best or only
way to express political concern about critical issues such as oppression, human
rights, immorality, communal trauma and economic security. We will assess
anthropological perspectives on colonial and postcolonial Africa, developing
critical, historical analyses of African expressive forms such as novels, plays,
music, spirit possession rituals, dance, film, videos and cartoons. Through the
popular cultures of diverse African communities, we will consider African
popular and political cultures, the politicization of identity, and the relations of
African communities to merging ethnic, national, religious and global networks.
Part of the international studies major; the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; the African studies concentration; and may be taken as an elective. (0510-210 or equivalent) Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

Anthropology Research Methods
Exposes students from a variety of backgrounds to an alternative means of understanding human behavior through the methods of the cultural anthropologist and
demonstrates that variations in cultural patterning exist in our presumably homogeneous society. The primary emphasis is involvement of students in the actual
observation of human behavior and collection of data in a subculture of their own
selection in the Rochester area. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered occasionally)
0510-502	
Archaeology and the Human Past
Archaeology is the study of the human past, from the origin of our species
through the development of modern, industrial states. In studying the past,
archaeology seeks to explain how we, as modern humans, came to be. This
course discusses how archaeologists study the past and explain how human
society has changed over time and presents an overview of world prehistory.
Specific topics will include the evolution of modern humans, the peopling of the
world, the development of agriculture, the rise of states and the development
of urban society. Case studies will be used throughout to demonstrate how
archaeological research is conducted and how archaeologists use their research
to formulate explanations of the past that have relevance for the present. Part of
the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; the Native American science and technology concentration; and the archaeological science concentration
and minor. May also be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)
0510-506	
Great Discoveries in Archaeology
Archaeology conjures a romantic image in the minds of many people and
almost everyone is at least familiar with some of the greatest discoveries made
by archaeologists. Finds such as King Tut’s tomb, the ancient city of Troy, the
jungle cities of the Maya, and Otzi the Ice Man, excite almost anyone who hears
of them. But what is it, aside from fabulous wealth, romantic locale, or incredible preservation that makes them great? Although great discoveries are always
exciting, archaeology is not only about finding things, but also about using
these findings to explain the human past. This course helps us understand how
and why human society has changed over time. It explores some of the great
discoveries of archaeology, many of which will be familiar to students. Part of
the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor; the archaeological science
concentration and minor; and may also be taken as an elective. Class 4, Credit
4 (offered annually)
0510-507	
Archaeological Science
Archaeology is one of the few social sciences that lends itself well to the application of analytical techniques from the physical sciences. This is largely due
to the fact that archaeology relies primarily on physical evidence. This course
examines the growing field of archaeological science. The course covers a number of archaeological questions including the age and origin of materials; how
things are made; what people ate; their daily activities; their state of health; and
how archaeological scientists are able to answer these questions using techniques from biology, chemistry, and physics. The course includes in-class labs
in which students apply some of these techniques and a final research project
in which the student picks their own archaeological question and methodology to answer it. Part of the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor;
the archaeology science concentration and minor; the material cultural studies
concentration; the Native American science and technology concentration; and

Archaeology of Cities
This course will focus on the pre-historical trajectories of urban development,
the multiple roles of cities, and their impact on the development of complex
societies in different world regions. We will attempt to explain how, in its multiple forms and manifestations, the city has developed and contributed to the
constitution of modern, industrial society. The course will consist of lectures,
in-class discussions and activities, group presentations, and a final research
paper that will be presented to the class. Part of the international studies program in a relative track; the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor;

Survey of Metallurgy
This course introduces students to the anthropological study of metallurgy.
The course begins with the survey of the earliest uses of metals and examines some of the early metallurgical treatises. Using archaeologically-derived
and modern data, we will explore ancient and current mining and extraction
techniques. We will also explore the meanings of metallurgical processes as
presented in ethnographic accounts. Using information and data derived
from scientific inquiry, archaeological excavations, and ethnographies, we will
examine basic metal refining and working techniques. Students will also learn
to interpret phase diagrams and study microstructures of metal samples. Part
of the archaeology concentration and minor; the sociology/anthropology concentration; and the material cultural studies concentration. May also be taken
as an elective Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)
0510-511	
Field Methods in Archaeology
This course introduces students to the methods of archaeological field work.
The course begins with the student’s development of a research question and
design. We then explore the feasibility of this research through the examination of sampling techniques, site survey, and excavation. Field methods of
recording, photography and artifact conservation will also be discussed.
Students will be able to analyze the usefulness of the field techniques in light
of the archaeological scientific methods for dating, and organic and inorganic
analyses. Students should emerge from the course understanding the values
of the techniques necessary for proper archaeological excavation towards the
reconstruction of the past and the development of an understanding of our
present. Part of the archaeology science concentration and minor; the sociology/anthropology concentration; the material culture studies concentration;
the Native American science and technology concentration; and may be taken

0510-512	
Garbage Archaeology
This course introduces students to the study of archaeological methods with
a focus on garbage (also known in colloquial speaking as rubbish, waste
and refuse). By studying garbage, we can study human behaviors in both
the present and past. This course’s hands-on component enables students to
learn about their immediate environment of Rochester through the collection,
sorting, and processing of garbage in their neighborhoods. We also learn and
employ the techniques of ethno-archaeology in order to understand the differences between what people do and what people say they do. Through weekly
readings we will consider how such topics as migration and settlement,
disease vectors, ethnicity and identity, and public policy are seen and interpreted through something that every human produces on a daily basis. Part
of archaeology science concentration and minor; and the sociology/anthropology concentration and minor. Class 4, Credit 4 (offered annually)

Traumatic Images
This course investigates visual culture and its imagistic responses to life’s
crises. Problems of identity and identification will be explored and confronted
through works of photography, painting, mixed media, new media and film of

and dead loves ones (as corpses and as ghosts), we then move on to consider
the last century’s fascination with pain and suffering, disease and violence,
struggle and survival and then the 21st Century’s emphasis on terrorism.
Specifically, we will focus on the gendering of images and imaging as disturbing pictures work to defy the formal and theoretical distinction between

This course is designed to give the student with a chemistry or materials science background a thorough grounding in the main concepts that describe
bulk polymer structure, behavior and properties. The course follows a synthetic path; the structure property relationships for polymeric materials are
built up from a microscopic to a macroscopic level. One of the most important
lessons of the course is that polymers are almost never in a thermodynamically stable state. Consequently, the behavior of polymers and the properties
they display are time dependent and vary with the thermo-mechanical history
of the materials. (1029-501, 502) Class 4, Credit 4 (F)

phase transitions, and 5) mechanical properties. The experiments, each requiring eight lab hours to complete, are designed to give students exposure to laboratory techniques not generally covered in undergraduate science/engineering
curriculum. Although the documentation of experimental results is important,
and will be evaluated, the main purpose is to give the student hands-on experience, hopefully piquing his/her interest in and enthusiasm for the field. (1008319, 1029-301) Lab 6, Credit 2 (S) (offered alternate years)

Vision and Psychophysics
The final “component” in many imaging systems is visual perception. The
human visual system can also be considered as an imaging system itself; arguably the most complex system, from visual optics through high-level cortical
processing such as the perception of depth and motion. An understanding of
the characteristics and limitations of the visual system aids in designing and
evaluating imaging systems. Unlike other elements of imaging systems, it is
difficult or impossible to get objective measures of visual perception; psychophysics provides tools for measuring perceptual mechanisms. This course presents an overview of the organization and function of the human visual system
and some of the psychophysical techniques used to study visual perception.
