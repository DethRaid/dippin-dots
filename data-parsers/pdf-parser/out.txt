Adding course from the accumulator
Materials of Construction
A study of common construction materials in civil engineering with particular emphasis on
Portland cement concrete and asphalt cement concrete. Aggregates, Portland cement, and
asphalt cement (each an ingredient in the concretes) are studied extensively. Mass-volume
relationships are explored in relation to these materials. An overview of laboratory testing procedures for evaluating these materials is provided. Important properties of masonry, steel, and
wood products are also discussed. (Co-requisites: CVET-141 or equivalent course.) Lecture
2, Credits 2 (Fall)

Materials of Construction Laboratory
The Materials of Construction Laboratory will be taken concurrently with CVET-140. Standard
laboratory tests will be performed for evaluating the properties of aggregate, Portland cement
concrete, asphalt cement concrete, and mortar. Mix design procedures for Portland cement
concrete and asphalt cement concrete will be learned and used. An introduction to green
building materials will be provided. (Co-requisites: CVET-140 or equivalent course.) Lab,
Credits 1 (Fall)

Computer Aided Design and Drafting
Introduction to engineering graphics as a means of communication in the technical fields.
The course is laboratory oriented and provides the student with basic skills to create and edit
professional 2D & 3D drawings with this comprehensive first course in the use of computer
aided design and drafting (CADD) software for (Mechanical, Architectural and Civil drawings). The course assumes no prior knowledge of engineering drawing or CADD. Lecture/
